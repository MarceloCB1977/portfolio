# Iron Rain

Bootcamp's first week project, to design a game using python

## Python libraries imported

for this project i used Pygame, Random, Math and Pygame.Mixer

### How the game works

You have to run it in python, the a window will pop-up, you will see little laptops
falling from the sky with job oportunities.
Below there is an IronHacker with open arms.
Pressing the arrow keys on your keyboard, moves the IronHacker from side to side.
The goal is to catch as many job offers as you can, before time runs out.

### Challenges

It was a big challenge at the time, because i knew little to nothing about python,
and even less about Pygame.
However with the guidance of the Bootcamp's Teacher and Teacher Assistants, i was able to
deliver, in less then a week, which was our dealine.
I am very proud of the result.
