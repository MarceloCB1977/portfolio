Although he embodies the spirit of classic House Music forms like old school Jackin and '90s era Chicago House, his underlying philosophy is quite simple - construct a beat that taps into the primal and speaks to the universal love of dance shared around the world. Growing up in the UK, Weiss accumulated a diverse range of musical tastes and influences, from Metallica to Motown and Phil Collins to Disco. An apprentice to Massive Attack’s Musical Engineer James Day early in his career, Weiss was able to draw from that deep well of inspiration and expert technical training to produce what would become a trove of instantly recognizable classics and unique, chunky, club rollers. /  / Weiss’ initial success as a producer was immediate and profound. His hit single “My Sister”, released in 2013, hit the top of the Beatport Charts and stayed there for four months. Assisted by a generous amount of support from BBC Radio 1, his sounds caught the attention of industry heavyweights like Annie Mac, Groove Armada, Green Velvet, Loco Dice, and Kenny Dope. After several years of successive hit radio singles like his 2016 “You’re Sunshine”, which premiered on Danny Howard’s BBC Radio 1 show and netted a spot at the top of the Beatport charts, Weiss’ profile continued to expand. It wasn’t long before his musical contributions and electrifying performances began to transform the modern House Music landscape. /  / With support from / JASON WOO / THICCOAS CAGE / ABRAHAM /  / ---- /  / Field Trip is our night for electronic music - mostly house, trance, breaks, and bass house.

Born in Dusseldorf, DJ T. (aka Thomas Koch) relocated to Frankfurt with his family in the late 70s. During his formative years, he fell for the hypnotic grooves of disco, inspired by his parents’ record collection. At the age of nine he was already completely enraptured by music and that love affair continues until this very day. He began an obsessive quest to collect music, feeding his soul with everything from Disco and Hi-Nrg, through to early Hip-Hop and Electro, Soul, Funk and R’n’B. The groovy, infectious rhythms of all those genres continue to permeate into the music he makes and plays today, providing an intrinsic part of his sound ethic. /  / He took up breakdancing, before becoming a DJ, playing at private parties initially before landing his first professional gigs in the late eighties. This period proved to be a pivotal moment in his life as Acid House swept through Europe, landing in Frankfurt and taking over with the launch of Sven Väth’s legendary Omen club in 1988. The first wave of House and Techno took hold and T. was there at the forefront, absorbing all the fresh new sounds from Chicago, Detroit and the UK. He picked up a residency at the infamous Music Hall and held residencies at countless clubs across the city during the next 10 years from Plastik and Dorian Gray to The Box. By the end of the nineties, he was one of Frankfurt’s best-known selectors. /  / In 1989 DJ T. tapped into another side of his creative energy to set up Groove Magazine. Identifying a gap in the market and fuelled by a need to satisfy his own desire for specialized music journalism, which focused on his interests – namely underground dance music. Under his leadership the magazine was launched into the public’s consciousness and he guided Groove to become one of Europe’s premier dance music publications, which it still is today. /  / DJ T.’s progression continued at a pace, as he launched his own club, Monza, using the experience gained through a decade of club events and tours under the Groove Magazine banner. He also invested his skills and knowledge into conceiving Get Physical – a label, which remains one of the world’s best- known House and Techno platforms. Though he left in 2010, T. still occasionally A&Rs for the label, lending his uncanny ability to uncover new talent to the seminal label. /  / Production-wise, he has been consistent ever since his debut release, the ‘Monsterbaze’ EP with Steve Bug, which was released on Poker Flat in 2000. Since then, T. has released several well-received EPs, a slew of remixes and three albums, ‘Boogie Playground’ in 2005, ‘The Inner Jukebox’ produced with Thomas Schumacher in 2009 and ‘Pleasure Principle’ in 2011. His special touch has also been employed by numerous labels to curate compilation mixes, including ‘United Under The Ball – 30 Years Of Disco’ in 2011 and ‘The House That Jack Built Vol 1 & 2’ in 2012. In 2013 he celebrated 25 years of DJing with a very personal mix compilation, followed also by ‘Body Language 15’ and collaboration with Defected and Strictly Rhythm to celebrate the latter’s 25th anniversary. DJ T.’s reputation for being a master selector has been cemented by these superlative collections of music, each of which has received widespread praise, often featuring many of T.’s own edits of classic tracks. /  / Despite so many accolades, his passion for music remains staunch, recently making several key changes to his professional life that have inspired him to explore new terrains. With hot new releases on AUS Music, Moon Harbour, True Soul and Jackathon representing his continued desire to push his creative boundaries. /  / A highly-skilled DJ and producer and an A&R with an uncanny ability to discover and nurture new talent, DJ T. is a master selector and one of the industry’s most influential figures. /  / Celebrating 30 years in the business with another world tour, he has brought his art to the Americas and Europe since the beginning of 2019 and will continue until the end of the year. For a few weeks now the cat is out of the bag: DJ T. has taken a new wave of inspiration to the studio where he is currently producing a new album for his old label Get Physical Music, the 4th one of his career. The album will see the light of day around early spring 2020, following a successful series of EPs, that have been released since last year and will be continued until the end of 2019. The name of the album («Trans Orient Express ») says it all, DJ T. is drawing a lot of world music influences from the cultural circles of the orient to inject them into a wide spectrum of Nu Disco aesthetics. A new world tour will follow the album from the end of March 2020. /  / https://www.facebook.com/deejaytea/ / https://www.beatport.com/artist/dj_t./10742 / https://soundcloud.com/djt / https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/djt / https://getphysicalmusic.com/ / https://www.discogs.com/artist/214669-DJ-T / https://twitter.com/DJT_akaT_Koch / https://www.instagram.com/dj_t._official/ /  / >> dubspeeka /  / dubspeeka is a Bristol (UK) artist who’s unique techno/house has given quick rise to their persona.

Technology changed the game a lot but the goal remains the same.” /  / Ben learned to mix in 1996 and just 2 years later became resident dj at the famed Moontribe Gathering, and started his own production company, Tropical. The first half of his career was mostly focused on DJing abroad, leading to 13 trips to Moscow’s Propaganda club, travel all over Russia, Spain, and Mexico, an appearance at Wiggle at Fabric in London and two at the Labyrinth Festival in Japan. /  / After marrying his love Jessica in 2009, Ben refocused efforts more locally, and is now one of the top West Coast festival DJs with recent appearances at Oregon Eclipse, Motion Notion (Can), Cascadia (WA), Lightning in a Bottle, Sunset Campout, and Desert Hearts (CA), among others. /  / Celebrating its 21st anniversary this year, Tropical has evolved from humble warehouse beginnings to 500-person summer boat parties and the legendary Tropical Oasis Retreat, an event which has brought together top artists from the West Coast 7 times in California and most recently, Kauai and Maui, Hawaii. A breath of fresh air in the sometimes ego-dominated dj and party world, Ben has donated over $30,000 to charitable causes through Tropical. /  / After 20 years of producing Tropical from Los Angeles, Ben Annand moved to Maui for 6 months to produce his top event production to date, the 300 person beachfront microfestival Tropical Oasis Retreat Maui March 29-April 2. Returning to the West Coast in late April, Ben went straight onto a 5-week tour with his family, finally landing in Eugene Oregon in June.

68,Noise Complaint fe,2/14/2020,"Noise Complaint, Two Nice, and the Kremwerk/Timbre Room Complex are proud to present, two rooms of thoughtfully curated music featuring: /  / Josh Wink  / www.joshwink.com / www.facebook.com/JoshWinkOfficial / www.instagram.com/joshwink1 / www.soundcloud.com/joshwinkofficial / www.twitter.com/joshwink1 /  / ""Some people get pigeonholed as being into just one thing’, Wink remarks, ‘I hate that. When there are rules, it doesn't become art, and it's not fun. I've learned that you can't please everybody, so I'd rather be concerned with making good art, and the people that like this art will stick with you."" /  / Philadelphia born and based Josh Wink is one of the true pioneers of techno, house and allied styles - blurring the definitions. /  / At 13, a young Josh Wink began his first job as an apprentice at Captain Jack’s mobile DJ Company, three years later, he had started to DJ at local house parties. By 1988 – the year that ‘rave’ exploded into public consciousness - Wink was already a main player on the underground music scene. /  / “Then I began to realize that I had ideas of songs. Instead of DJing other people’s music, I wanted to translate these ideas into my own music that was in my head. House music and new wave electronic music really influenced me when I was a teenager. Plus, going to see Jazzy Jeff and Cash Money DJ in Philly made me want to get more into the 'art' of DJing.” /  / In 1990, just out of his teens, Wink released his first EP ‘Tribal Confusion’ on the infamous Strictly Rhythm imprint, under the moniker E-Culture (with King Britt), also releasing other EPs under various different guises.  / Josh Wink’s Ovum imprint, since its beginnings in 1994, has seen releases from Loco Dice, Shlomi Aber, Marc Romboy, DJ Pierre, Aaron Carl, King Britt, Steve Bug, D’Julz and of course his own productions. It still continues to grow by both introducing new talents and releasing one-offs from some of the world’s best known producers. “Ovum is about integrity to good music! We feel that we don’t have to follow the music that is trendy or fad-like at the moment.” /  / As a DJ, since his 1988 ‘rave’ beginnings, Josh Wink extensively traveled the globe since 1995 – playing every festival that counts, through to the smallest and underground venues around the globe. “The Best DJ experience is being able to create an audio atmosphere where an audience can absorb from me, while I get absorbed from them.” His only residency in the world is held in his hometown of Philadelphia at Fluid. /  / Taking trends, making trends and breaking trends, Josh Wink’s music (under its many monikers including Wink, Winc, Winks, Winx, The Crusher, E-Culture, and Size 9, Accent, Dinky Dog, J Dawg and The Crusher) has always experimented and influenced. The sound of Josh Wink today remains one of a man unafraid to walk the border between stylistic boundaries. /  / LOCAL SUPPORT FROM: /  / RECESS / PHOSEPH / NORECALL /  / ---------------------------------------------- /  / UPSTAIRS IN THE TIMBRE ROOM /  / TWO NICE TWO YEAR ANNIVERSARY /  / ROSKA / HYPHO B2B XAKRA / INSTANT RELOAD  / --------------------------------------------- /  / VERY LIMITED $10 TIER 1 Tickets available NOW /  / Ticket Prices: /  / $10 Tier 1 / $15 Online Pre-Sale  / $20 Day of Show @ Door  /  / 21+ /  / -- / ABOUT NOISE COMPLAINT /  / Gone is the party where the music and the people at the party mattered more than making money.

Born Wolgang Robinowitz in the jungles of Micronesia, he was assumed to be an anime gene splicing accident due to his naturally blue hair. He traveled across the globe as an underground youth voice actor before settling in the concrete jungles of Brooklyn where the strong influences of tech house, DIY punk rock, & hentai took root in our hero's heart. /  / Bursting onto the SoundCloud scene of the mid 2010s, Luca made a name for himself deftly avoiding copyright infringement with a discography of flips, edits, and remixes that it is as eclectic as it is electrifying; contributing heavily to a burgeoning collection of internet based artists pushing the frantic and melodic sound that would later become future bass. After getting his shit together and realizing those student loans weren't gonna pay themselves, he hit the club circuit in earnest, earning accolades for his iconoclastic and frantic style of mixing tied together by a turbulent stage presence that echoes hardcore punk sensibilities far more than his bottle service slinging dance music contemporaries.

Under these aliases you’ll find sweeping emotive cuts, verdant dancefloor workouts and discerning dips into jungle and breaks. Releases have come on respected labels including Meda Fury, Ectotherm, UN.T.O and Lobster Fury: the collaborative label from Lobster Theremin and Meda Fury begun for the explicit purpose of releasing his tracks. /  / DJ Seinfeld’s beats are ultimately guided by an idea of authenticity, true to the spirit of the early house pioneers and the unabashed rawness the confines of their equipment demanded. A lot’s been made of this lo-fi fuzz, with many clamoring to declare it a scene, but he won’t be put into a box. His path is his own. A microphone picks up the tension and release of a singer: charged with emotion, the machine can’t handle it. The rough edges of his productions emit the same sensibility. / Footage of his gigs or their post-show reaction exemplifies the reception he gets as a DJ. Biographies often claim a DJ regularly ‘sends crowds into rapture’ or ‘lays waste to the floor,’ but in DJ Seinfeld’s case pandemonium is the default. Mixes show his deft control of build-up and feel in the booth, while his mini series for legendary London station Rinse FM in May ‘DJ Seinfeld presents...’, was a master class in the kind of wonky left-field house he peppers his sets with. /  / ……………………………………… /  / Sign up for the Kremwerk + Timbre Room Complex mailing list on our website, to stay in the loop about upcoming events, ticket giveaways and more! / http://www.kremwerk.com/ /  / ……………………………………… /  / Kremwerk strives to be a safe space.

Such was the setting for recording Nuclear Recitals, Vol. 1. Can radical creativity catalyze individual, local and global climate action? We believe so. This public demo reflects on fragility of our Pale Blue Dot; centers music as a universal language evoking human and planetary interconnectedness; and advocates direct action in mitigating Anthropocene.  /  / - - - /  / DETAILS: /  / At this multimedia showcase, O (TYPONEXUS founder, Jack Straw Cultural Center Artist in Residence, and 4Culture Artist) will share work in progress on the international, site-specific, creative climate justice project, Nuclear Recitals. Vol. 1 features world's fastest pianist and pioneer of Continuous Music, Lubomyr Melnyk (Ukraine). Recital audio is now in post-production toward physical and digital release. Presentation includes current audio edit, visuals, exhibit, and forum focused on radical creativity and social engagement as tools for policy change.  /  / - - - /  / Capacity: 40 / Admission: bpt.me/4513597 / All contributions directly support Nuclear Recitals project  /  / - - - /  / IN DEPTH: /  / Nuclear Recitals commenced in 2017. Working with notable, international, cross-genre artists at a nuclear site, the intent is to produce, release and share a multimedia series of visceral, thought-provoking, inspiring odes to human creativity, beauty and goodness in juxtaposition to ruinous overreaches of industrialization. The aim is to encourage public dialogue about climate crisis, sustainability, and the importance of creativity and activism in finding solutions to our shared predicaments in the wake of Anthropocene.  /  / For the inaugural installment, O joined forces with Ukrainian virtuoso composer, Lubomyr Melnyk.  /  / We recorded this living legend's signature Continuous Piano Music set live, en plein air, on a 9-foot Steinway grand at a nuclear facility. The nonstop set consisted of original, improvisational, neoclassical avant-garde material generated exclusively for this thematic, site-specific engagement. The recital took place at high noon, cascading up to 20 keystrokes per second per hand, reverberating skyward through the monolithic edifice. A butterfly cemetery underfoot. Specters of Chernobyl and Fukushima stirred. Vivacious birdsong and grungy, industrial sound artifacts superimposed onto etherial music tapestry...  /  / - - -  /  / “The question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be.

With an open mind, Magda will try her hand at whatever feels right – from music technology collaborations and events to producing premium Tequila – creating a truly unique, multifaceted expression of herself. /  / Born in Poland and raised in Detroit, Magda discovered beauty and inspiration in rawurban landscape. In 1998, she joined Minus and began touring as Richie Hawtin’s opening DJ. /  / In 2006, Magda established the Items & Things label and booking agency with Troy Pierce and Marc Houle. In 2017, she launched the Perm event series in Berlin. /  / Sitting pretty at the crossroads between art and club culture, Perm is a collective initiated by Magda and established in the name of artistic cross-pollination between Perm residents and visiting live performers. Musical guests are curated, then presented within a strong multimedia aesthetic crafted by the team. Guests have included Atom TM, Burnt Friedman, Jan Jelinek, and Cristian Vogel. /  / Since her first international tour in 2003, Magda established herself globally as an artist known for pushing musical boundaries and expressing her unique style. Magda first made her name as part of Richie Hawtin’s Minus label family, releasing her forward thinking DJ mix album ‘She’s A Dancing Machine’ in 2006, followed by her debut artist album ‘From The Fallen Page’ in 2010. Magda’s remix work includes Plastikman and Depeche Mode and DJ mix albums for Fabric, Balance as well as aBBC Radio 1 Essential Mix. /  / Recently, Magda has produced and performed alongside T.B. Arthur as Blotter Trax and recording with Ectomorph’s BMG. Blotter Trax combines modular synthesis, live improvisation and rhythmic exploration. Performance highlights have included live audio-visual duets with video artist Lillevan (Morton Subotnick, Christian Fennesz) and a recent club tour of Japan which saw the duo performing live and transitioning into Magda’s signature DJ sets. /  / Magda is amongst the most high-profile and in demand artists, having proven herself as a consistent, adventurous and exceptional performer, with a knack for bringing music together in unexpected ways. /  / AIDA / AIDA can be found at the intersection of two contrasting worlds: rich Iranian roots and a serene west-coast Canadian upbringing.This dichotomy is infused in everything she crafts. It’s here that she blends various genres with a mastery of someone who lives and creates at the boundary of their duality. Combining elements of world-inspired music with electronic, she gives colorful twists to masterful blends of groovy house, techno, and breaks geared for the dancefloor. /  / Her’s duality extends beyond her music career into yet another realm of the senses. As a designer, AIDA is a rare entity fully dedicated to creativity and movement. Embodied with focus and discipline, she inspires others that it’s possible to excel where they find themselves at an intersection, crossroad, boundary. . . or just a dancefloor. /  / ……………………………………… /  / Kremwerk / 1809 Minor Ave. / Seattle, WA / http://kremwerk.com / 21+ /  / ……………………………………… /  / Sign up for the Kremwerk + Timbre Room Complex mailing list on our website, to stay in the loop about upcoming events, ticket giveaways and more! / http://www.kremwerk.com/ /  / ……………………………………… /  / Kremwerk strives to be a safe space.

Born in the Swedish city of Örebro, weekends were spent playing and exploring the forests surrounding her home, alongside lessons in piano, flute, ballet and later singing. In the years following, she graduated with a Master in Pharmaceutical Science but eschewed a career in pharmacy to focus on music full-time.

Engaging in her sets is like sitting with her at a card table while the chaos of the casino persists in the periphery: glances of determination alongside a type of stoicism about fun are passed around, undermining your confidence of the game, questioning your initial goal to win, diffusing what you thought it meant to win at anything.Known internationally during the IDM days as The Square Root of Evil, Jen now delivers dense, driven techno, as solid as urban pavement. Nancy Dru is where Jen's personal and deep comprehension of sound marches through each corner and transition of her set. Rendering her work more potent is its vocal aridness. Though this style is alive with language, it is an idiosyncratic, non-verbal kind, accessible to all who are at least level two versed in techno. Having shared the stage with the likes of Steffi, Voices From the Lake, Carl Craig, Headless Horseman, Shed, Hodge, Dasha Rush, Rødhåd, Erika, Kangding Ray, Andy Stott, Annie Hall, Matrixxman and many more, as well as playing celebrated sets at Basscoast, Mutek, Soundwave, and Communikey, Jen has gained a laudable reputation as not only an artist with a severe approach to music, but also as a techno advocate with an esoteric, tenacious language, argot required for propelling the global dance community forward into its unknown, tremendous future. /  / Tickets Available soon! /  / =========== / Timbre Room / 1809 Minor Ave / Seattle, WA / 21+ w/ID / =========== / Timbre Room does not tolerate bigotry, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, misogyny, ableism, or any discriminatory actions.

107,[CANCELED] Secondn,3/13/2020,"Hi Everyone, /  / After a lot of soul searching, we've made the decision to cancel tomorrow night's party. This was a very difficult decision for us to make - the first time in over six and half years of throwing parties that we've cancelled one - but in light of the rapidly evolving situation with Covid19 and the recently announced bans on events over 250 capacity in King County, we feel that canceling secondnature is the right thing to do. Our relationships with the people who come to our parties are incredibly special to us, and we would never want to do anything to put you or your loved ones in danger for one night of fun. /  / We understand that this is an uncertain time for everyone. Therefore, refunds will be available on request to those who want them (with no judgment or questions asked). However, we want to be transparent about the financial impact that cancellation will have on us. We still have to meet several contractual obligations and forfeit deposits, so if you are able to afford the ticket price without a refund, your support will go a long ways towards making sure that secondnature is still able to offer the kind of high-quality experiences you've come to expect from us when this crisis is over. We know that our community consists of people in many different financial situations, so we leave the decision in your hands with the promise that any refunds we give will be entirely free of resentment or judgment.

𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗸’𝘀 𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟬💚☘️ /  / 𝟬𝟯.𝟭𝟳.𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟬, 𝟭𝟬𝗣𝗠 - 𝟮𝗔𝗠 | $𝟭𝟬 𝗗𝗼𝗼𝗿, $𝟱 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 /  / St. Patrick’s Day, the one day of the year where the Irish people and their culture is celebrated, is very near and dear to NorthLeft’s heart...after all, we were founded by someone who spins under the name Shamrock. It's been said that the sons and daughters of É𝘪𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘯 have personalities that are a mixture of hot temper, stubbornness, great personal charm, warmth, tolerance and a wit that shines through adversity...but more than anything else, we are known for our ability to celebrate. Even in the worst of times, we’ll find a silver lining and raise a glass with our friends and family.  /  / Traditionally, St. Patrick’s Day is known as the Feast of St. Patrick because March 17th often falls in the period of Lent, during which Catholics are expected to give up certain luxuries, in particular, not eating certain kinds of foods and restrictions on the consumption of alcohol. However, one day during this period, for the Feast of St. Patrick, the church lifts all restrictions allowing for the loss of all inhibitions and pursuing vices with reckless abandon. On this day, the Irish stuffed themselves with their favorite foods and drank their favorite whiskey...sometimes a bit too much whiskey. While intended to be a religious holiday honoring Ireland’s patron saint, because of the lifting of moral restraints, it became a celebration of celebrating for celebration’s sake. More than that, it became a celebration of the Irish people themselves.  /  / So on this St. Patrick’s Day, when everyone is allowed to be Irish for a day and are free to indulge themselves to their heart’s content, there’s no better music to lose yourself in than that of house. We’ve assembled a collection of some of the best local DJs, all of whom are eclectic in their own way, but are particularly skilled at the craft of house music, to make this a night to remember: /  / Performing at her first NorthLeft show, 𝗗𝗬𝗥 (𝘜𝘯𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘚𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘴 | 𝘙𝘦𝘧𝘭𝘦𝘤𝘵), we’ve never had an event better suited her. From a rich Irish background, Colleen Burns, AKA DYR, is an expert executioner of a wide spectrum of genres including house, techno, disco, often weaving multiple genres into a single set. This innovative young DJ has gained a lot of momentum as of late, which is in large part due to her prowess at house. The stark upward trajectory of DYR’s career has given her opportunities to be featured at some of Seattle’s premier venues including the Kremwerk-Timbre Room Complex, Q and Re-Bar. She not only is becoming increasingly prominent in her hometown, she also is branching out internationally, performing at venues in Reykjavik, Iceland and Budapest, Hungary. /  / Another DJ who has huge momentum right now is 𝗝𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗺𝘆 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗻 (𝘋𝘓𝘊 | 𝘜𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘦_𝘙𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴). Since the first of his many NorthLeft performances, Linden has become one of the hardest working DJs in Seattle, with frequent performances all across the city at its most well known venues. Just as the rest of the members of the lineup, Jeremy can spin a plethora of genres, but he particularly excels at house music. An advocate of the Seattle house music scene, being an essential figure in the launching of the Seattle Church of House Music to prominence, he is an expert at straight forward pure house, deep house and his own unique brand of 4/4 with a sound that has heavy house overtones. /  / If Seattle has a house purist, it is it’s native son 𝗝𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗲𝗿 (𝘚𝘵𝘶𝘥𝘪𝘰 4/4 | 𝘏𝘰𝘰𝘥 𝘗𝘰𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘤𝘴). He is one of the most sought after house DJ/producers in Seattle, especially when it comes to providing support for touring international headliners or performing at events that are local house music institutions. Since its humble origins, house music has evolved into a dynamic genre spanning a wide spectrum of different variations of the core house aesthetic. There is no more knowledgeable student of all these variations than Jesse. While largely focusing on house, he is known for his ability to be eclectic with sets that span house music’s entire spectrum in a single set. /  / Lastly, there’s the hybridic DJ 𝗦𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗸 (𝘕𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘩𝘓𝘦𝘧𝘵 | 𝘗𝘪𝘜𝘯𝘓𝘛𝘋) whose style typically resides in the gray areas between house and techno. Recently though, he’s rediscovered his house music roots and has been fervently engulfing himself in the genre. However, Shamrock being Shamrock, his recent house sets mash and mangle several subgenres of house into an organized chaotic exploration of 4/4. Largely relying on certain types of tech house, he also integrates progressive house, deep house, deep techno and even some leftfield.  /  / This March 17th may be a Tuesday, but do as the Irish have always done...blow off your responsibilities, don’t think of the consequences until the next day, wear your green and dance the night away with us on this very special night.  /  / While St. Paddy’s is a day of indulgence, if you indulge a bit too much, please make sure to have a designated driver or some other alternative means to get home.

The same year, the “Techno Corner” EP was released on Form Music, his friend Popof’s label. A remix was also commissioned by Moby (“Stay Down”). In 2011, he confirmed his standing in the Techno scene by releasing his second EP with Plus 8 Records (Hermanos Ep). /  / In 2012, Julian Jeweil released his third EP with Plus 8 Records (Bastard EP), featuring five tracks played and supported by the greatest artists out there.

They were followed by the excellent “Mad” EP with Form Music. /  / Julian also signed in 2013 three releases with Minus, Richie Hawtin’s renowned label: “Don’t Think” EP (Number one in the Beatport Top 100), “She’s Hot” EP, and a remix for the Techno Master, Adam Beyer, who produced alongside Ida Engberg the track “Unanswered question” on Drumcode. In 2014, he released two more EPs with Minus: “Rumble” and “Los Pistolos” E P. /  / In 2015, amidst an increasingly dense touring schedule, more releases were met with astounding success: a new EP, “Bird”, on Minus and a remix, “COAR,” commissioned by artist Marc Houle for his album Restored (release date: April 2015, also on Minus). Fall 2015 in particular saw a series of remixes released – commissioned by legend Pete Tong, Sian, Pig & Dan and Joseph Capriati. September also saw one of the artist’s greatest achievements: four of his tracks were simultaneously listed in Beatport’s monthly Top Ten Best Selling tracks : “And We”, “Meteorite”, “Bird” and “Wax”. End of 2015, Julian Jeweil was officially crowned Number 1 Techno DJ on Beatport. In 2016 Julian Jeweil released another EP on Form Music, “Destination”, an instant success critically and commercially.  /  / One year later, following an intensive touring schedule highlighted by multiple performances worldwide on the Ultra Music Festival/Resistance stage, the French heavyweight resumed working with Adam Beyer and released his first - and hugely successful - two EPs on Drumcode, “Rolling” and “S pace”.  /  / In 2018, Julian Jeweil was finally ready to release his first LP, “Transmission” LP, also on Drumcode.

Father of Two & 'nohup' in Timbre Room (upstairs space). /  / Tickets: http://bit.ly/DepthRobertHood / Kremwerk-Timbre Room Complex Combo tickets are available which grants access to Timbre Room as well. /  / ……………………………………… /  / About... / ROBERT HOOD / Robert Hood needs little introduction. Founding member of the legendary group Underground Resistance as a ‘Minister Of Information’ with ‘Mad’ Mike Banks & Jeff Mills, his seminal works on Jeff Mill’s Axis and his very own M-Plant imprint paved the way for a wave of stripped-down dancefloor minimalism that directed much of techno’s path throughout the late Nineties. /  / Robert Hood makes minimal Detroit techno with an emphasis on soul and experimentation over flash and popularity. /  / Having recorded for Metroplex, Jeff Mills’ Axis label, as well as Patrick Pulsingers ‘Cheap’ label, Peacefrog, and more recently Music Man, Hood also owns and operates the M-Plant imprint, through which he’s released the bulk of his solo material. /  / He has only released 2 ever CD mixes one for French label Logistic, and a mix for the club ‘Fabric’ mix series��”Growing up in Detroit, I grew up with Motown in the house – a lot of Motown and Philadelphia soul, artists like Marvin Gaye of course and Curtis Mayfield. /  / I remember Isaac Hayes, the soundtrack from ‘Shaft’ had come out. My father was a jazz musician; he played piano, trumpet and drums. My mother was in an R’n’B group.� We listened to a lot of Motown – in fact, my grandfather’s first cousin is Berry Gordy.� “I was influenced by my father – I wanted to play trumpet like he did.”� Robert’s father tragically died when he was just 6. The photo of Robert sitting down holding a trumpet is his fathers. �”I had to beg my grandmother to let me borrow the trumpet to take a picture with it” /  / In the early 90’s he began to concentrate on his own production ‘Vision EP’, the ‘Riot EP’ and X-102 were big stepping-stones for him as they were the first releases he worked 100% on his own. The X-101 to X-102, were Waveform Transmission projects with Mills for Tresor. He slowly progressed to work more and more on his own, but collaberated on some of the first Axis releases with label owner Jeff Mills as H&M (Hood & Mills) with ‘Tranquilizer EP’ and ‘Drama’.�� He soon decided it was time for him to start his own label to focus on what was in his soul musically. /  / M-Plant started in ’94. I had developed this “grey area” sound – what I mean by that is that in Detroit, even when the sun is out, there’s something in the atmosphere. I don’t know if its pollution or whatever, but the sky has that grey haze over it. It’s got to be something from the industrial factories there. I’d never really heard a sound like that before and it came from a Roland Juno – it was a chord sound that really went along with my depiction of what Detroit was at that time. A lot of buildings were abandoned and there was a lot of lifelessness in the city, especially downtown. The M-Plant, in minimalism, kind of reflected that. /  / I remember thinking of Detroit like a museum. You know, like a work of art standing still, suspended in time. There wasn’t a whole lot of activity going on. /  / Releasing singles such as “Internal Empire”, “The Protein Valve”, “Music Data,” and “Moveable Parts”, “The Pace”, more recently “Range”, “Alpha” and that isn’t even touching his other monikers Floorplan, Monobox, The Vision, etc.� “M-Plant is what I’ve always wanted to hear: the basic stripped down, raw sound. Just drums, basslines and funky grooves and only what’s essential. Only what is essential to make people move. I started to look at it as a science, the art of making people move their butts, speaking to their heart, mind and soul. “It’s a heart-felt rhythmic techno sound. M-Plant is just M. minimal.” /  / ……………………………………… /  / Kremwerk / 1809 Minor Ave. / Seattle, WA / http://kremwerk.com / 21+ /  / ……………………………………… /  / Sign up for the Kremwerk + Timbre Room Complex mailing list on our website, to stay in the loop about upcoming events, ticket giveaways and more! / http://www.kremwerk.com/ /  / ……………………………………… /  / Kremwerk strives to be a safe space.

He is 5 foot 7 inches in height and weighs about 165 lbs. His brother, Bill works at the Port Of Seattle and has four children, two of whom are actually step-children. Bill’s wife owns a local publication and is a skilled bicyclist (even though she has not gone professional.) /  / When David works in his studio where he makes electronic music, his wife brings him a drink and discusses her day. The door-keeper comes in to give him a telegram sent the previous year from the Eolian Islands. /  / In 2010 he wrote an album of music which was released by Freerange records. A year later David’s first and only daughter, Eloise Sylvia was born. She was 5 pounds 11 ounces at birth. David spoke only English and cooked meals for his family every day until 2013 when a company called Systematic Recordings contracted him for another album. /  / Besides writing music for night clubs and headphones, Pezzner composes music for vision and function, and teaches electronic music writing concepts to anyone who will pay him money. He sleeps exactly like any other man but, as you will no doubt have noticed, he is not an orthodox painter of the old school, but rather a modern artist. A designer. / ---------------------------------- / Shameless was established in 2003 in Seattle, starting off as a weekly underground dance night in the basement of the Alibi Room.

150,Nightmares on Wax Smokers Delight 25th Anniversary Tour (DJ set),4/24/2020,"Nightmares On Wax will return in April, 2020 on a worldwide tour in celebration of the 25th Anniversary of his seminal album – Smokers Delight. A defining record of the mid 90s which set Nightmares on Wax on their own musical trajectory, Nightmares main man George Evelyn will be rekindling his much-loved downbeat blend of soul, hip-hop, dub and timeless club sounds, start to finish, with a full orchestrated live show next year. /  / He says “It’s amazing that i’m talking about my album Smoker Delight 25 years later! To say this will be an honour to perform this album live in its entirety at this point in my life right now, is an understatement. I’ve had so many incredible experiences from releasing music throughout my career, but let me share the fact that this album changed my life and opened me up to new opportunities of how I could produce music going forward. I am forever grateful for this moment in my life, bringing this back to the stage with such a special live show is going to be delightful on many levels.” /  / Smokers Delight was one of a handful of records to define a generation along with Massive Attack’s Blue Lines, Portishead’s Dummy and Tricky’s Maxinquaye. It took George Evelyn from his electronic-genre-blending debut 1991’s A Word of Science, into releasing the iconic downtempo, soul and hip hop material for which he has become renowned. Music lovers from around the world were intoxicated by this bassy, afterhours sound that became the backdrop to a million late-night living room sessions. Smokers Delight managed to capture that feeling and add a dash of light to the darkness, changing the musical landscape for Nightmares and the still young Warp label forever. /  / Evelyn’s recent output includes the critically and commercially acclaimed Nightmares on Wax Back to Mine compilation, released earlier this year, which saw him take the helm of the compilation for its 20th Anniversary, and his long-awaited eighth album Shape The Future [2018]. Energized by a recent run of globetrotting DJ sets, including residencies in Ibiza and London, Nightmares on Wax’s return will also hold some surprises.

Joe action figures in the early 80’s, Detroit native Marcellus “Malik” Pittman was playing his radio at maximum volume, listening to the sounds of “the Wizzard” and the “Electrifying Mojo”, in addition to the jazz outputs of Rosetta Hines. /  / Malik began his DJ pursuits for college parties, wedding receptions, “old school parties” in the early 90’s. In 1993, Malik released his initial work of production with local Hip-Hop collective “Home Grown”. /  / Shortly thereafter, he released “Essential Selections, Vol. 1” on the Sound Signature label, headed by Theo Parrish. In 1998, Malik forged a working relationship with Rick Wilhite, Theo Parrish and Kenny “Moodymann” Dixon, collectively known as the 3 Chairs. As production artists and selectors, they have helped to define an integral part of the Detroit sound.Malik’s sound has been around the Detroit and surrounding areas, as well as internationally, spanning Canada, the UK, Germany, Japan and Paris. /  / His dedication to production ushered the discontinuation of his latest residency with Northern Lights in Detroit.

Oscar G /  / OSCAR G –Made In Miami /  / (Made In Miami, Murk, Nervous Records) /  / As one half of the Murk production team along with Ralph Falcon /  / If you were to get out a map and track the history of house music – with endless lines sprouting from New York, Chicago and Detroit to points all over the world – you’d have to make a big, red circle around Miami, Florida, and start drawing. /  / Miami was never ground zero to a full-fledged sub-cultural movement. But it is where Oscar Gaetan, better known as Oscar G, has lived every day of his life. And that fact alone makes it a hub on the global underground. /  / An award-winning songwriter, producer, and DJ, Oscar is one of dance music’s brightest and most enduring stars. As part of seminal production teams Liberty City, Murk, and Funky Green Dogs, he boasts hits – Billboard chart-toppers as well as underground smashes – in every decade, every trend, and every market. “Some Lovin’,” “Fired Up,” and “Dark Beat” are more than just tracks: They are moments, shared by clubbers worldwide. They’re the kind of moments Oscar still creates at clubs worldwide, as he continues to headline the world’s premier venues and sell out shows with each appearance. /  / Oscar and longtime friend and production partner Ralph Falcon grew up in a Miami enlivened by the fresh spirit of hip-hop. “Break dancing, graffiti and the music that went along with it: That’s really what got me into DJ-ing in the first place,” he says. By the age of 12, he was already spinning at school dances. /  / Oscar and Ralph started working together at the end of high school, blending the sounds of their youth with the beginnings of house, like Ten City and Blaze; and the darker Euro bands of the time, like Depeche Mode and New Order. “We were always big on doing our own sound, with our own feeling and vibe in every aspect of it; from the way we mixed things to the sounds we chose,” says Oscar. “I remember being obsessed with that for years, and then people started to listen.” /  / The early years bore some of the work for which they’re still best known, like often imitated, never duplicated vocals “Some Lovin’,” “If You Really Love Someone,” and “Reach For Me” (Tribal). Upon their release in 1993, the pair became instant superstars. “Europe kind of grabbed us,” says Oscar, so they spent a good amount of time touring overseas, eventually visiting every major and minor outpost of the global dance scene, including Zouk Singapore, Ministry Of Sound London, and Stereo Montreal. /  / “Fired Up!” (Twisted), their biggest hit ever, followed in 1996. It topped the Billboard Dance chart, and even cracked the Top 100, peaking at No. 80. They would go on to remix countless major pop artists, from Madonna to Cher to Donna Summer; and appear on mainstream outlets like MTV and Top Of The Pops. The boys also cut two complete Funky Green Dogs albums for major label MCA, “Star” (1999) and “Super California” (2001). But their own measures of success were still decidedly underground: “Once Junior Vasquez played our records at Sound Factory [in New York], we felt like we could retire, and at that point we were like 20,” says Oscar. /  / In March 2000, Space opened in downtown Miami with Oscar as the Saturday night resident, just as the world was paying its annual visit for Winter Music Conference. The club – with its cavernous main room, pummeling German sound system and nitrogen blasts – was the talk of dance world, and the legend of Oscar’s residency began to grow. Eventually Oscar’s marathon Space appearances during his 8 year residency would become essential rites of passage for anyone who wanted to experience Miami nightlife. /  / The year 2003 was a big one. Oscar released the “Live @ Space” (Star 69) compilation, and won the Club World Award for “Best Resident DJ” (which he won again in 2007). Murk set a new Billboard Dance chart record, with five No. 1’s in a single year: Four singles from their self-titled artist album on Tommy Boy Records, and “Dark Beat” (Twisted), tribal house’s first real vocal anthem, which found its way from dance floors onto mainstream radio. “We came up with ‘Dark Beat’ in about 15 minutes. Whenever things come that quickly, you know there’s something to them,” says Oscar. “But we didn’t think radio or anthem; we were thinking more like, ‘Oh man, Danny Tenaglia’s gonna be all over this!’” /  / In 2006, Oscar became one of Pacha New York’s only non-NY-based monthly residents, strengthening his bond with his home-away-from-home, and its rich dance history. He released a second installment in the Space series in 2007, starting new relationships with Nervous Records in the U.S. and CR2 in the U.K. CR2 also snapped up the Murk catalog, and commissioned new remixes of the classic tracks, including Paul Woolford’s takes on “If You Really Love Someone” and “Reach For Me.” /  / While visual content in connection with music has been vital since the emergence of MTV, Oscar had the foresight to see that this would soon play a role in DJ mixed packages as well. In 2007 he released a documentary / long form music video included in the Oscar G / Space Miami audio release on Nervous and CR2, and he went one step even further in 2009 in releasing the Oscar G / DJ (DēJā) CD / DVD. The DVD for that package was a complete visual recording of 70 consecutive minutes of one of Oscar’s legendary Space Miami sets, and is considered the definitive visual rendition from this seminal venue. The DJ (DēJā) release was also the source of three Oscar G singles that became anthems at clubs worldwide; specifically “Back To You,” “What You Need” and “Your Love,” all of which featured vocals from his long-time collaborator Tamara Wallace. /  / In addition to the two DVD’s, the year 2008 marked the release of Oscar’s debut album as a solo artist. Released on both physical and digital formats, the release of “Innov8” on Nervous Records would also mark the beginning of an especially prolific production period for Oscar G in terms of album releases. 2010 saw the release of “Live From NYC,” a DJ – mixed compilation recorded live at Pacha NYC; in 2012 Oscar released a mixed CD entitled “Beats” to great acclaim and followed that up in 2014 with Beats Vol 2; in 2016 Oscar released the double CD Beep My Boom artist album, which was also the source of another immediately embraced anthem entitled “Rain feat. Seri.” /  / While his reputation as a solo artist has continued to grow along with his well-known persona as one of the world’s premier DJ’s, Oscar has also continued to do special collaborative projects with his Murk partner Ralph Falcon. Together they produced one of the definitive underground house anthems of 2012 entitled “Amame feat. Jei” under the artist alias Intruder. This single was released worldwide on Defected Records. And he and Ralph also re-activated the seminal label Murk Records. At the same time Oscar in 2016 also launched the Made In Miami record label, which has emerged as a premier platform for both veteran and new Miami talent. /  / Even though his passion for music creation is undeniable, it’s in his DJ booth where Oscar feels most at home. “On the music side, I’ve felt pretty energized lately, because the changes in the industry really enable you to be a lot more experimental and take more chances,” he says. “But DJ-ing to me always comes first: I really believe in it as an art form. Having a residency like Space, with a regular crowd, it’s the ultimate.” /  / His connection with the house music fans of New York has always been strong, and the past few years has seen residencies at Output in Brooklyn, and Space Ibiza New York in Manhattan, both of which lead to multiple sold out appearances. With Brooklyn the new epicenter of nightlife in America, Oscar has been invited to play virtually every significant club in the borough, and has continued to sell out shows with each appearance. In his hometown, his annual Made In Miami Pool Party in March is now known as one of Miami’s most important events celebrating homegrown talent. In addition he maintains two weekly residencies in the 305. Fridays he is at 1-800-Lucky with his Rice & Beats Party, and Mondays he is in Coyo Taco’s event room in Wynwood with his Murk Mondays event brand. /  / Earlier this year in Feb 2019 Oscar released his “For The Culture” album on Nervous Records. For this project Oscar presented 12 original recordings that musically expand the boundaries of what fans typically expect from the genre, but at the same time retain the tribal house based, thick and layered percussive house elements that he’s known for. /  / For The Culture” included musical contributions from several of Oscar’s music collaborators in his hometown of Miami including DJ / Producer Lazaro Casanova, live percussion specialist and vocalist Oba Frank Lords, producer Stryke, vocalist Katiahshé and brass player Ronald Rodriquez. /  / January 18th 2020 lets welcome Miami's premier ambassador of HOUSE MUSIC!

220,Nowadays Nonstop: New Years,1/1/2020,"Alright, this one very close now and if you're coming through we're real excited to be ringing in the next decade with you soon. There are a few things worth reading before we get started: /  / ☻ THE TICKETS / ENTRANCE: /  / - If the ticket tiers above are greyed out and have a line through them it means that it's not possible to get any more in advance.  /  / - We'll do our best to make it possible to buy tickets on the door but this is entirely dependent on our capacity inside throughout the party. If you don't have a ticket and you want to come, best to be down here before 10pm, between 3am and 7am or after 1pm. /  / - If you have a ticket, you have to arrive between the hours listed on your ticket. To illustrate: if you buy a ""5am to 2pm"" ticket, your first entry should be between 5am and 2pm, but you can stay and re-enter until the party is done; if you buy a ""2pm - close"" ticket, you can only enter after 2pm on New Years Day. /  / - Once you've come in during the designated window time on your ticket, you can come and go as you please. If you don't enter during the designated window of time, you'll lose your spot and need to buy a new ticket (assuming there's space inside). Once you're inside, can also stay as long as you'd like as long as you abide by our safer space policy (more on that below). /  / ☻ THE REFRESHMENTS: /  / - We have a 24 hour liquor license for this so it will be possible to buy alcohol at the bar all night and day. /  / - If you're coming to the Planetarium portion of the party (6pm - 10pm) food from Diner by The Izakaya will be served buffet style between 6pm and 7.30pm. /  / - We'll have bar snacks and paninis available from 10pm onward and we'll have some breakfast items available from 7am onward. /  / ☻ SAFER SPACE: /  / In an effort to create a space where all people feel safe, we don’t allow any of these things within our walls or in our back yard: /  / ⇢ Violence / ⇢ Non-Consensual Touching / ⇢ Racist, Homophobic, Transphobic, Sexist or Other Discriminatory Language / ⇢ Leering /  / If someone says or does anything to make you feel uncomfortable while you’re here, let us know. All our bartenders, security, managers, sound staff and door staff can help you. /  / ☻ PHONES AND PHOTOS: /  / For the sake of the vibe, please don’t use your phone or take pictures on or around the dance floor.","6pm – Weird Science: Amourette, Maroje T and mscln, 11pm – Analog Soul, 2am – Club Fitness, 5am – Justin Carter, 8am – Avalon Emerson, 2pm – Shaun J.

These anniversary parties are always a nice way to reflect on how far things have come since our very humble beginnings. /  / We are very happy to have snagged Haruka on his first North American tour. Haruka is well established in Japan, where he became a resident and co-organizer of DJ Nobu’s Future Terror parties, has played a b2b set with our label artist Wata Igarashi at Labyrinth and he just announced the launch of his new record label, Protection. While it’s unusual for us to have a Bunker rookie play a peak time set at the anniversary, we love Haruka’s sound so much that we’re confident he’ll knock it out of the park.  /  / Opening the night will be our label artists and frequent collaborators, Clay Wilson and rrao. Clay Wilson’s hypnotic music has been the foundation of his releases on The Bunker NY, as well as his tripping live sets that combine years of studying free improv with an innate feel for techno and beyond. With only a couple of tracks out overall, rrao has been quickly turning heads with their ethereal take on both ambient and rhythmic electronics that induce trance-like meditative states, and has a solo release coming on our label this year. Both artists are also professional sound engineers who are dedicated to getting the most out of whatever sound system they’re playing on. /  / We can’t think of a better way to close out this night than handing the reins to long term resident DJs and acid brothers Mike Servito and Derek Plaslaiko for one of their legendary b2b sets. It’s been about 2 years since we unleashed this duo on a NY audience alongside Paranoid London. As anyone who has experienced their b2bs at The Bunker, Panorama Bar, and No Way Back can attest, there is always something special in the air when they share the decks.",Haruka / Mike Servito / Derek Plaslaiko / Clay Wilson / rrao,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1357497,BASEMENT,new york,Camp Gateway - Staten Island,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115197387/camp-gateway-staten-island,40.6036,-74.0588,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.7152945', '-73.9136973'

318,Veronica Vasicka / Hieroglyphic Being Live / John Barera,1/10/2020,"◾️ VERONICA VASICKA ◾️ When, in 2005, Veronica Vasicka reissued Oppenheimer Analysis’ early works for her nascent Minimal Wave label, no one knew how apt that name would become. Though largely focused on archiving lost treasures from the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, the label would become a focal point for a new wave of artists who embraced the machine funk of analog equipment and raw power of straight-to-tape performance. Vasicka’s offshoot Cititrax took on this bold new crop, featuring landmark releases from Marie Davidson, An-i, Broken English Club and more. Her DJ sets remain as ahead of the curve as her curation, drawing on 4+ decades of synthetic mutations. /  / ◾️ HIEROGLYPHIC BEING ◾️ In the almost 25 years since he launched his Mathematics label (the first release was “very limited” and “only available out of his backpack”), Jamal Moss aka Hieroglyphic Being has built one of the most daring catalogues in electronic music. Rooted in Chicago house and industrial music, but spanning free jazz, experimental, harsh noise and techno, his music marries afro futurist cosmologies to rugged-yet-seductive grooves. In recent years he’s blasted through avant garde workouts with the Sun Ra Arkestra and Wolf Eyes, released landmark LPs on Soul Jazz, RVNG Ltd and Planet Mu, worked closely with Moog and toured the globe relentlessly. “I’m working through my sorrows inside the machines” he told the Guardian. “I’m thinking of this whole other galactic picture, of trying to make the world a better place.” He plays an extended live set. /  / ◾️ JOHN BARERA ◾️ John Barera is the co-founder of Jack Dept, the long-running techno/acid night and label he runs with Volvox, co-founder of Supply Records, producer for 2MR, member of B-Tracks and an internationally touring DJ.

He hosts weekly primetime Saturday afternoon show on BBC Radio 6 Music that’s one of the broadcaster’s most popular music shows, helms independent record label Brownswood Recordings, and is the founder of online radio station Worldwide FM. Throughout his career, Peterson has promoted the new frontiers of jazz, hip-hop, and electronic music. He has been behind several game-changing record labels. Firstly, he founded Acid Jazz Records in the late eighties, and later he started Talkin' Loud, whose roster included Incognito, Galliano, Young Disciples, Courtney Pine, MJ Cole, Terry Callier, The Roots, 4hero, Nuyorican Soul, Carl Craig’s Innerzone Orchestra and Roni Size's Reprazent project. Five of the albums on Talkin Loud were nominated for a Mercury Prize, with Reprazent’s New Forms winning in 1997. His current venture, Brownswood Recordings, was formed in 2006 and has released Ghostpoet’s Mercury Prize-nominated debut album and the 2018 We Out Here project, a celebrated compilation showcasing the UK’s thriving young jazz scene. As a curator and collector, he’s compiled over 100 albums. /  / ==== /  / As one the most important tastemakers Europe has to offer, and affiliated with labels Brownswood, Blue Note, !K7 Records, Stones Throw and Jazzy Sport, LEFTO is consistently a couple steps ahead of your average early adopter. Firmly rooted in jazz and hip hop, he sharpened his digging sensibility working at the now legendary Music Mania record store in hometown Brussels. His passion for jazz resulted in a remix album for Blue Note which was well received by the community. Lefto is forever moving forward but always has an ear in the past. Famed for his gloriously eclectic DJ sets, he switches effortlessly between hip hop, funk, breaks, neck-snapping beats, future bass, South-American influences, bruk riddims and some wild African rhythms. World renowned, LeFtO regularly blesses sound systems from Tokyo to Seoul and Singapore to New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. He has been a resident deejay for Gilles Peterson's Worldwide Festivals since 2008 around the world.  /  / ==== /  / Brownswood Recordings is the independent record label founded by DJ, record collector and broadcaster Gilles Peterson. Founded in 2006, it’s a platform for new artists to grow, and a space for established acts to break with tradition. An outlet for the eclectic breadths of Gilles’ taste as a DJ and collector, its early output broached new orchestral arrangements, full-throttle Japanese jazz and club-rooted soul music. Over a decade later, that inclusive attitude continues. Its output spans the new jazz messengers of the UK underground, fresh tangents in hip-hop-tipped-beatmaking, and snapshots of Havana's burgeoning club culture.","Gilles Peterson, Lefto, Brownswood Soundsystem",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1370354,Turntable Lab,new york,Camp Gateway- Brooklyn Ny,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115196040/camp-gateway-brooklyn-ny,40.5958,-73.8858,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.7308591', '-73.9899409660737'

At ISSUE, he presents a new live show entitled Akklamation, a performative compositional cosmos that sets out to unify the expansive and divergent musical paths of the electronics master. From his origins in the German new wave, to his pioneering work in the intersection of dub and various strands of electronic music, to his more recent forays into the fringes of experimental music and composition, Akklamation serves as an investigation into the future of rhythmic structures, timbral architecture, and an exploration of the psycho-physical effects of repetition. /  / 2017 ISSUE Artist-In-Residence Antenes (Lori Napoleon) returns to ISSUE to present a new iteration of her ongoing exploration of material from the NOKIA Bell Labs Archives -- a research process that has run parallel to her practice of appropriating antique and/or otherwise obsolete objects in ways that reference and extend their original functionality. Further refining, processing, and spatializing this material, Napoleon combines synthesis with binaural recordings of Bell Labs artifacts from telecommunications history paired with microscopic sounds produced by personal objects from her life (shells, wires, rocks, old watches, etc.) recorded within the famed The Murray Hill anechoic chamber, the world's oldest wedge-based anechoic chamber built in 1940. Notably, she also uses hand-made equipment built during her residency, including a switchboard that electronically controls 90's flip phone motors Napoleon salvaged -- creating organically unfolding rhythms, drones and resonances within these items, including a replica of the first liquid transmission telephone. /  / American composer Britton Powell presents “If Anything Is,” a new work exploring themes of hyper-reality and ambient capitalism through a mixed-media environment designed for sound and multichannel video. Filmed and recorded over the course of 2019 the work explores an ecstatic exchange of experience in the face of a much-accelerated media and commercial world. A meditation on the intersection of technology, ritual, and urban landscape, the work draws a map through scenes filmed in New York City and points the audience towards the collision at this crossing.","Moritz von Oswald, Antenes, Britton Powell",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1356790,ion / Antenes / Britton Powell,new york,Camp Gateway- Brooklyn Ny,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115196040/camp-gateway-brooklyn-ny,40.5958,-73.8858,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.6906095', '-73.98937055'

527,Just The Right Height / Drumloop,1/23/2020,"Thursday, January 23rd, ISSUE is pleased to present Just The Right Height, the solo music project of interdisciplinary artist Keke Hunt, and Drumloop, the recent moniker of artist and musician Daffy Scanlan, each presenting new solo work. Both artists chart critical new contexts at the intersection of fragmented narrative, sound design, pop music, song, and experimental composition. /  / Self-taught and independent in its vision and approach, Just The Right Height is an investigation of pop lyricism and idiosyncratic songwriting. Focusing on rhythm stripped of melody, repetition, detailed arrangements, and unique sound sources as her dominant compositional techniques, Hunt intersperses her catalogue with heartfelt, melodic tracks. At ISSUE, she performs songs from her last two albums, Let Forever Be Only You Tonight, released last year on 2018 ISSUE Artist-In-Residence James K’s She Rocks! label, and POST​-​FERGIE WHITE CHRISTMAS, released on Nick Klein & Miguel Alvariño’s Primitive Languages imprint. She will also perform new work from an as-yet unannounced upcoming album. Previously, Hunt has used online lyric generators that algorithmically recombined lyrics from existing pop songs as the starting point for many of her hybrid narratives, in her words “creating songs that are original while being reminiscent of previously expressed words and sentiments [...] intended to be overused and uncanny [...] something I notice in my favorite songs.” An inspired combination of noise, fashion, homemade and lo-fi aesthetics, folk, and pop music, the project is an at-times unhinged presentation of highly original songcraft. /  / Daffy Scanlan’s work has long drawn on the lines between electronic and organic sonics. Composing climatic melodies scaled up to expansive, affecting vistas, Scanlan combines heavily processed vocals and poetic storytelling -- exploring fragmented collage and pop stylings in equal measure. A skilled pianist as a child, she worked between analog gear and Fruity Loops throughout her youth, releasing harsh noise and power electronics on a string of labels. But it was after her suitcase was stolen in 2017, containing almost all of her music equipment that Scanlan dove deep into FL Studio, turning a trying moment into an opportunity for deep sonic exploration of the software. The result were compositions with extensive nuance, accents, and details all flecked with digital detritus and swirling waves of echo -- hovering between emotional meltdown and resilience. In 2018, Scanlan released her debut album Revenge Body as Drumloop via Sweat Equity. She continues to self-release tracks through SoundCloud. /  / Keke Hunt is an interdisciplinary artist based in New York. Hunt has performed and released music solo electronic music under various monikers including Just the Right Height since 2014. She has toured with acts such as Odwalla88, Sapphogeist, and Via App. She has releases on Primitive Languages and ALL GONE tapes and SheRocks! Hunt’s earliest music was released as You Nori and collaboration with Marisa Takal. She has also collaborated with Multimedia artist Bryan Edward Collins on a project called Hard World Fashion. She is currently working on her 3rd album and working as a tattoo artist. /  / Daffy Scanlan is an artist from New Jersey, who is currently based in New York City. Her work explores the transportation of objects / language through time and space, channeling their degeneration and disembodiment. She combines cracked and broken textures with dinged color stories, creating portals into a canon of abuse and trauma. Her compositions resemble cornucopias of disintegrating figures, like glowing bunches of archaic characters. She believes disappearing is equal to omnipresence.","Just The Right Height, Drumloop",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1370535,Issue Project Room,new york,Camp Gateway- Brooklyn Ny,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115196040/camp-gateway-brooklyn-ny,40.5958,-73.8858,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.6906095', '-73.98937055'

She’s also a terrific DJ. /  / ■ Pfirter (Argentina) — Argentinian-born, Barcelona-based veteran DJ and producer Juan Pablo is widely known and respected equally for his DJ sets as well as for his output as a producer and label owner through his own imprint, MindTrip, whose collaborators include Jonas Kopp, Stanislav Tolkachev, Antigone, Milton Bradley, Pär Grindvik, and Jeroen Search. /  / ■ Victoria Mussi (Paraguay) — A #rare Unter and The Black Hole double-alum, Victoria Mussi basically runs underground techno in Paraguay. In the wake of a narco-state-led shut-down of the club she was attached to, she now books and promotes her own now-off-the-grid night Sequence, and in case her name sounds familiar, she just HAPPENS to be the cousin of another Unter favorite, the Brazilian producer and DJ Amanda Mussi, with whom she shares a penchant for igniting Brooklyn dance floors. /  / ■ Volvox (Brazil) — Unter Resident Number 1 since Day 1, Volvox was born in—and is still inextricably connected to—Brazil and its queer underground electronic music dance scene.  /  / ■ 138, live (Mexico) — Based in Los Angeles, 138 is the collaborative duo of Mexican artists Billy Garcia and Nathan Valle.

Living up to her moniker, which translates as “she who cannot be escaped,"" Adrestia has been invited to smash parties from Brooklyn to Berlin. /  / ■ Xiorro (Puerto Rico) — Co-founder and resident DJ of ALKHEMY and The Black Hole, and resident DJ at Berlin’s Griessmuehle, Puerto-Rican artist Xiorro is a leading force in delivering the harder and faster edges of techno on the Brooklyn scene. /  / ■ Buzzi (Cuba/Peru) — Born and raised in Bushwick, Brooklyn and Ridgewood, Queens, Cuban-Peruvian artist Buzzi is a resident DJ of ALKHEMY & The Black Hole.

570,Miki Beach NYC 'Fun Raiser,1/25/2020,"Hello Mausketeers,  / Come join us for a dance party fundraiser for our Love burn and Burning Man Camp, packed with amazing talents. Miki Beach Camp will return to Burning Man in 2020, and whether you're already part of the MikiMau family or are new to our vibe, we'd love your support as we work to spread good times and good music, on and off the playa!  /  / SAVE THE DATE: Saturday - January 25, 2020 /  / ::: About MikiMau ::: /  / MikiMau started from the simplest of concepts – good people sharing a common love. The group is diverse; members hail from different countries, live in different cities, and work in a range of industries. But through this eclectic community runs one intense bond: Love of House Music. / ​ / If Miki Mau was a baby, then it was conceived in Ibiza 2013. A casual group of friends gathered to revel in some of the best house music in the world, and within a few days, the once loosely-knit group found themselves transformed into a tight family — one that continued to dance its way through Winter Music Conference, Burning Man, and countless parties.  /  / With each new adventure — combined with the inspiration to explore, create, and share new beats with one another — the group grew larger. Soon sets were being composed on weekends; speakers and turntables were purchased; and DJ nicknames began to emerge... Alas, MikiMau was born. /  / The term “Mickey Mouse” is at times used to refer to something substandard, or poorly executed and/or organized. As the group gained momentum in their musical efforts, they adopted this label as ""MikiMau"" — giving it a Cuban spin to pay homage to the background of a few founding members. Proving the group’s aspiration is not stardom or profit, but to create music for friends by friends. And to always have fun! /  / 21+ /  / This event is fully supported by the ebb + flow family! / www.ebbandflowmusic.com /  / www.mikimaumusic.com / www.facebook.com/mikimaumusic / www.soundcloud.com/mikimaumusic / www.instagram.com/mikimaumusic / www.instagram.com/kimonodisco","Doc Martin, David Mayer, Gavin Stephenson + Iman Rizky, Tarek Hanna, Jeremy Sisselman",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1365511,Lost Circus,new york,Camp Gateway- Brooklyn Ny,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115196040/camp-gateway-brooklyn-ny,40.5958,-73.8858,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.7107222121212', '-73.9272022121212'
571,Regis / Fiedel / Ne/Re/A,1/25/2020,"◾️ REGIS ◾️ Few artists can claim to have truly shaped music’s evolution even once; Regis has done it a few times. As the co-founder of Downwards, he played an instrumental role in developing the Birmingham techno sound. Growing out of Jeff Mills’ and Robert Hood’s more extreme minimal explorations, Regis’ earliest recordings were landmarks in brutalist industrial hypnosis. In collaboration with Surgeon as British Murder Boys and with Function, Silent Servant & Female in the Sandwell District collective, releases like “Learn Your Lesson” and “Feed Forward” set the bar for modern techno, influence a generation of artists with their combinations of thundering kicks and mercurial, mesmerizing sound design. /  / ◾️ FIEDEL ◾️ Fiedel has been something of a dark horse in electronic music, releasing landmark EPs, helming a residency at Berghain and cultivating a long-running relationship with the seminal Wax Treatment crew. Yet his sound remains surprising and fresh, shirking the expected muscle flexing of those associations for a lighter touch. Where his peers often go big, Fiedel goes weird. His grooves have a spring, his synths a glooby effervescence. That’s not a slight; his bright, unvarnished pallette kills - tracks like “Andreas” or any of his collabs with Errorsmith as MMM make quick work of the dancefloor. Last year he showcased his approach to DJing on the “Berghain 08” mix. In typical fashion, he skipped the studio and went straight to the club, recording it in the heat of the moment. /  / ◾️ NE/RE/A ◾️ Part of BK’s new wave of heavy, no-holds-barred DJs, Basque DJ & Distrikt1 founder Ne/Re/Ea bangs out heaving, saturated techno, EBM etc with a punk spirit.

Largely recorded in 1997 using single takes with minimal post production, these four drones contain every intended fluctuation and tone, along with every glitch of the original – “Artifacts generated by your listening environment are an intrinsic part of the experience.”","Quo Vadis Presents:, Drew McDowall + Florence To [Time Machines / Live AV], Pod Blotz (live) , Scallywag",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1368008,Elsewhere,new york,Camp Gateway - Staten Island,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115197387/camp-gateway-staten-island,40.6036,-74.0588,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.709397', '-73.9231657'

699,Funneled Smoke: Vito Ricci with Lise Vachon / Pontiac Stre,2/1/2020,"Saturday, February 1st, ISSUE presents an evening of audio/visual collaboration with interdisciplinary artists and curators Funneled Smoke, prolific composer Vito Ricci with vocalist Lise Vachon, and Philadelphia-based experimental duo Pontiac Streator & Ulla Straus. /  / Funneled Smoke is a multimedia art and curatorial project which attempts to create a cross-convergence between varied audiences, promote diversity, and integrate experimental electronic music, visual art, and rave culture. Founded by Yiyang Cao and George de Moura in 2018, Funneled Smoke has since presented work from both established and under-represented artists in underground spaces across Brooklyn and recently contributed live video installations for Interzone Festival and Unsound (NYC). For this event they will be installing an immersive 3-channel rear projection rig with live video and large scale paintings. /  / Vito Ricci is a composer from the 1980’s downtown New York scene whose work was revived in 2015 with a retrospective double LP on the Belgian label Music From Memory. Vito has been composing work for decades working in genres that include punk, modern classical, jazz, and ambient electronic and has created scores for theatre and modern dance productions. Some of his collaborations have included work with Rashied Ali, Peter Zummo, Byard Lancaster, Blue Gene Tyranny, and the Flux Quartet. He will perform alongside Lise Vachon, singer-songwriter born and raised in Montreal. She spent years in New Orleans singing jazz and contemporary music. A resident of New York City for many years, she has been performing with Vito Ricci. Vocalise is her latest recording, produced by Ricci. The two perform an electronic meditation on “the world we are leaving our children.” /  / Philadelphia-based experimental duo Pontiac Streator & Ulla Straus also present new work. Having recently released full-length LP 11 Items and their debut collaborative release Chat on Huerco S.’s West Mineral Ltd imprint, the duo demonstrate a highly-developed sensibility for producing ambient interzones that transmute fleeting, everyday feels into ephemeral and organically unresolved compositions. Their recent work reveals a greater variegation of their overgrown, verdant electronics -- an ambiguous style that has become key to West Mineral Ltd.'s aesthetic. The music is neither gloomy nor ecstatic but full of transitory sensations somewhere in between those poles -- pulled in multiple directions at once, resulting in a sublime schism between true experimentalism and heavy-rhythm. /  / Yiyang Cao (b. 1991, China) is a Brooklyn-based multi-disciplinary artist and designer born and raised in Hangzhou, China. She received her BFA in Film/Animation/Video at Rhode Island School of Design. Through moving image, participatory sculptural environments, and live video performances, Yiyang’s work investigates the rhetorics of time in new media; exploring the cross-pollination between out-of-screen and in-screen time, she attempts to provoke dimensional thought on perception and our collective states of being. She utilizes a wide range of video sources in her work including analog modular synthesizers, computer-based generative programs, recorded camera footage, and motion-graphics. She has exhibited and performed in US, Japan, Mexico, Germany, Netherlands and Denmark. /  / George de Moura (b. 1986, New York City) is a Columbian-American artist working in painting, animation, and experimental electronic music. de Moura’s painting explores figuration in dark environments, drawing parallels between the work of Caravaggio and contemporary nightlife culture. As a musician under the moniker “Serpent in a Straight Line” de Moura uses synthesizers, field recordings, turntables, and computer software to create work that draws influence from avant-garde tape music, cyberpunk, and left-field techno. He is a frequent collaborator of the feminist performance artist Narcissister and has performed at spaces such Studio for Art and Architecture, Envoy Enterprises. He was a 2017 resident at EMS in Stockholm, and was included in A.L. Steiner’s collaborative installation in the 2014 Whitney Biennial. /  / Vito Ricci's leading edge instinct and creativity have made him a vital and prolific composer of illuminating and compelling works. Infused with poignancy and honesty, his music has the power to linger in the listener's memory. An artist who has been called "" composer of wide ranging and obsessively fascinating collection of works"" by the Wire, and his soundtracks compared to ""heirloom seeds put back in circulation"" by Pitchfork and ""elegant and snappy"" by the New York Times. Vito Ricci has been on the leading edge of the downtown music scene since 1979. During his thirty-year-plus career, Mr. Ricci has scored over fifty productions including concert music, theater, dance, performance, film and video. His collaborative works include partnerships with Bob Holman, Martin Goldray, Rashied Ali, Flux Quartet, Jacob Burkhardt, Lise Vachon, and The Wooster Group. Performances of his works have been presented at The Skyball Theater, The Public Theater, La MaMa Theater, Greenwich Music House, Cooper Union, Roulette, The Knitting Factory, St. Marks Church, The Performing Garage, the Walker Arts Center and the Southern Theater, both in Minneapolis. Recent accomplishments include a performance at MOMA/PS1 with Bob Holman in November 2017, one with Lise Vachon at Pacific Rhythm in Vancouver in August 2017, a residency at Sisters, Brooklyn in 2016 with Lise Vachon, a performance at ISSUE, August 2015 with Lise and the late Steve Dalachinsky, scoring ""Philosophies"" for the Complexions Contemporary Ballet who went on to tour the world in 2007. Recent recordings are ""My Little Life"", a book/cassette published by séance-centre in 2017, ""Symphony for Amiga "", a vinyl commissioned by Intelligent Instruments in 2016, a double vinyl, ""I was Crossing a Bridge"", a collection of his works by Music from Memory in 2015, the recording of a CD of his string quartets ""I Don't Know Who I Am"" by the Flux Quartet in 2009, and producing, composing and playing on Lise Vachon's CD ""Vocalise"" in 2006 with stellar musicians, Rashied Ali, Peter Zummo, Byard Lancaster and Blue Gene Tyranny. /  / Lise Vachon was born in Montreal where she grew up singing with her family. She studied piano and oboe. Always interested in songs whether in the French tradition or from other countries and time, Lise was always into the human voice. Her early work with Luc Cousineau, a singer/songwriter with whom she recorded and toured, was followed with an association with the Ville Emard Blues Band. She then created Toubabou with Michel Seguin, a percussionist, playing in concert and recording. She then ventured solo, writing. Always moving further musically and vocally she traveled in South America, the Caribbean Islands, Western Europe, Mali, Senegal, Togo, Ivory Coast, and the American Deep South. During her years in New Orleans, Lise continued her vocal explorations and song writing. She collaborated with new music composers and taught at Loyola University. Currently living in New York City, Lise has been working with Vito Ricci, an American composer and her partner in life. Commitment to exploration, influences, travels and an abiding interest in experimentation has taken her from her early singer/songwriter tradition to art songs, jazz, to contemporary music, electronic ambient, genre crossing to a spontaneous vocabulary of her own.","Vito Ricci, Lise Vachon, Pontiac Streator, Ulla Straus",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1370537,or & Ulla Straus,new york,Camp Gateway- Brooklyn Ny,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115196040/camp-gateway-brooklyn-ny,40.5958,-73.8858,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.6906095', '-73.98937055'

722,Funneled Smoke: Vito Ricci with Lise Vachon / Pontiac Stre,2/2/2020,"Saturday, February 1st, ISSUE presents an evening of audio/visual collaboration with interdisciplinary artists and curators Funneled Smoke, prolific composer Vito Ricci with vocalist Lise Vachon, and Philadelphia-based experimental duo Pontiac Streator & Ulla Straus. /  / Funneled Smoke is a multimedia art and curatorial project which attempts to create a cross-convergence between varied audiences, promote diversity, and integrate experimental electronic music, visual art, and rave culture. Founded by Yiyang Cao and George de Moura in 2018, Funneled Smoke has since presented work from both established and under-represented artists in underground spaces across Brooklyn and recently contributed live video installations for Interzone Festival and Unsound (NYC). For this event they will be installing an immersive 3-channel rear projection rig with live video and large scale paintings. /  / Vito Ricci is a composer from the 1980’s downtown New York scene whose work was revived in 2015 with a retrospective double LP on the Belgian label Music From Memory. Vito has been composing work for decades working in genres that include punk, modern classical, jazz, and ambient electronic and has created scores for theatre and modern dance productions. Some of his collaborations have included work with Rashied Ali, Peter Zummo, Byard Lancaster, Blue Gene Tyranny, and the Flux Quartet. He will perform alongside Lise Vachon, singer-songwriter born and raised in Montreal. She spent years in New Orleans singing jazz and contemporary music. A resident of New York City for many years, she has been performing with Vito Ricci. Vocalise is her latest recording, produced by Ricci. The two perform an electronic meditation on “the world we are leaving our children.” /  / Philadelphia-based experimental duo Pontiac Streator & Ulla Straus also present new work. Having recently released full-length LP 11 Items and their debut collaborative release Chat on Huerco S.’s West Mineral Ltd imprint, the duo demonstrate a highly-developed sensibility for producing ambient interzones that transmute fleeting, everyday feels into ephemeral and organically unresolved compositions. Their recent work reveals a greater variegation of their overgrown, verdant electronics -- an ambiguous style that has become key to West Mineral Ltd.'s aesthetic. The music is neither gloomy nor ecstatic but full of transitory sensations somewhere in between those poles -- pulled in multiple directions at once, resulting in a sublime schism between true experimentalism and heavy-rhythm. /  / Yiyang Cao (b. 1991, China) is a Brooklyn-based multi-disciplinary artist and designer born and raised in Hangzhou, China. She received her BFA in Film/Animation/Video at Rhode Island School of Design. Through moving image, participatory sculptural environments, and live video performances, Yiyang’s work investigates the rhetorics of time in new media; exploring the cross-pollination between out-of-screen and in-screen time, she attempts to provoke dimensional thought on perception and our collective states of being. She utilizes a wide range of video sources in her work including analog modular synthesizers, computer-based generative programs, recorded camera footage, and motion-graphics. She has exhibited and performed in US, Japan, Mexico, Germany, Netherlands and Denmark. /  / George de Moura (b. 1986, New York City) is a Columbian-American artist working in painting, animation, and experimental electronic music. de Moura’s painting explores figuration in dark environments, drawing parallels between the work of Caravaggio and contemporary nightlife culture. As a musician under the moniker “Serpent in a Straight Line” de Moura uses synthesizers, field recordings, turntables, and computer software to create work that draws influence from avant-garde tape music, cyberpunk, and left-field techno. He is a frequent collaborator of the feminist performance artist Narcissister and has performed at spaces such Studio for Art and Architecture, Envoy Enterprises. He was a 2017 resident at EMS in Stockholm, and was included in A.L. Steiner’s collaborative installation in the 2014 Whitney Biennial. /  / Vito Ricci's leading edge instinct and creativity have made him a vital and prolific composer of illuminating and compelling works. Infused with poignancy and honesty, his music has the power to linger in the listener's memory. An artist who has been called "" composer of wide ranging and obsessively fascinating collection of works"" by the Wire, and his soundtracks compared to ""heirloom seeds put back in circulation"" by Pitchfork and ""elegant and snappy"" by the New York Times. Vito Ricci has been on the leading edge of the downtown music scene since 1979.

She studied piano and oboe. Always interested in songs whether in the French tradition or from other countries and time, Lise was always into the human voice. Her early work with Luc Cousineau, a singer/songwriter with whom she recorded and toured, was followed with an association with the Ville Emard Blues Band. She then created Toubabou with Michel Seguin, a percussionist, playing in concert and recording. She then ventured solo, writing. Always moving further musically and vocally she traveled in South America, the Caribbean Islands, Western Europe, Mali, Senegal, Togo, Ivory Coast, and the American Deep South. During her years in New Orleans, Lise continued her vocal explorations and song writing. She collaborated with new music composers and taught at Loyola University. Currently living in New York City, Lise has been working with Vito Ricci, an American composer and her partner in life. Commitment to exploration, influences, travels and an abiding interest in experimentation has taken her from her early singer/songwriter tradition to art songs, jazz, to contemporary music, electronic ambient, genre crossing to a spontaneous vocabulary of her own.","Vito Ricci, Lise Vachon, Pontiac Streator, Ulla Straus",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1370537,or & Ulla Straus,new york,Camp Gateway- Brooklyn Ny,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115196040/camp-gateway-brooklyn-ny,40.5958,-73.8858,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.6906095', '-73.98937055'

774,Rebekah / Shlømo / GIA,2/7/2020,"◾️ RSVP: http://bit.ly/BSMTFeb7FB /  / ◾️ REBEKAH ◾️ “I want people to experience that feeling that I had when I was 17, just like, what the fuck is going on? Just being assaulted with records and grooves and different things” This is how Rebekha described her artistic mission to RA in 2017, and a quick glance at any of her recent sets will bear that out. Compared to her more linear peers, the CLR & Soma artist brings a vital diversity to her sets. Constant rhythmic interplay, bristling flourishes and uncompromising impact give her sets the kind of masterful freshness that can only come through decades behind the decks. Her hybrid sets often combine DJing with live hardware workouts, fusing her excellent production & selector chops. Following the release of her long-awaited debut album “Fear Paralysis,” Rebekha has dropped some of her most destructive works yet - EPs like “My Heart Bleeds Black” on Mord and “Murder In Birmingham” on Soma start at code red and only escalate.  /  / ◾️ SHLØMO ◾️ Taapion Records co-founder and Concrete resident Shlømo brings a loopy finesse befitting his hometown of Paris. Gnarly synths and cracking drums are blended with a liquid elegance and dramatic flair. His Tome EP for Delsin exemplifies the type of simmering slow burn that can take over a dancefloor when you least expect it. Recently he’s expanded into live sets, and also brought his ambient work to Berlin Atonal under his own name Shaun Baron-Carvais. “I’m thirsty for discovery” he recently told an interviewer. “I don’t want to put any boundaries on my music, especially in my own productions.” /  / ◾️ GIA ◾️ Brooklyn based artist GIA’s sets at parties like Melting Point up the ante on the city’s recent ride-or-die approach to hardcore rave demoliton.

A unstoppably fun reworking of a forgotten turn-of-the millennium europop hit, its glistening trance arpeggiations push an already deadly track over the edge.

838,John Mccowen: Solo Contra,2/8/2020,"John McCowen presents an evening of compositions for solo contrabass clarinet for his inaugural performance as a 2020 ISSUE Artist-In-Residence. These works present the concept of the contrabass clarinet as an acoustic synthesizer. By sustaining multiple sounds simultaneously, the clarinet becomes a harmonic tube where sounds interact and create beating harmonics. Through the use of internal microphones, small sounds become more audible, and bass more physical; allowing for a more visceral listening experience. The evening includes premieres of new compositions. /  / Taking cues from electronically-generative musics, spectral music, the ebbing and idling of automotive engines, and years of close study and collaboration with Roscoe Mitchell, McCowen deals with the interactions, fluctuations, and spectral shifts of pitch relationships. This language is commonly executed through circular-breathing as a means to create density and development. However, through solo performance, McCowen attempts to buck the stigma of circular-breathing solo performance as a physical struggle, but rather an embodied focus through the transformation of anxiety. /  / John McCowen is a Brooklyn-based composer and performer originally from Southern Illinois. His work focuses on extending the possibilities of the clarinet & contrabass clarinet. John embraces long-form drones, difference tones, and beating harmonics as a means to extrude the dimensions within - treating the clarinet as an acoustic synthesizer. His discography includes releases on Edition Wandelweiser, International Anthem, Astral Spirits, NNA Tapes, Cairn Desk, and others. Performances include Le Guess Who Festival (Utrecht), Norður og Niður Festival (Reykjavik), Hot Air Music Festival (SF), Bowling Green New Music Festival, Supersonic Festival (Birmingham), Berkeley Art Museum (BAMPFA), The Stone, San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and Constellation (Chicago). John was a 2017 & 2019 artist-in-residence at Lijiang Studio in Yunnan, China. He received the Elizabeth Mills Crothers Award for excellence in music composition in 2016 from Mills College where he also received an MA in Music Composition under the mentorship of Roscoe Mitchell.",John McCowen,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1378599,Issue Project Room,new york,Clear Creek Information Station,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115201866/clear-creek-information-station,34.27,-118.1532,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.6906095', '-73.98937055'

849,Rave Scout Cookies x Dancesafe #001: NYC,2/9/2020,"In 1971, Richard Nixon declared drug abuse ""public enemy number one"" of the United States, and so launched the War on Drugs. The DEA was formed in 1973, and with it came mandatory prison sentences for non-violent drug-related crimes. It wasn't until the '80s when Ronald Reagan really buckled down on drugs, causing a surge in incarcerations, primarily targeting poor people and people of color.  /  / The War on Drugs still rages on today, though less public and with shifting dynamics. It is widely accepted that the tactics of punishment and stigmatization continue to fail in getting people to stop using drugs. In fact, studies show that they more than likely have the reverse effect, while also causing severe trauma to poor communities of color. The harm reduction movement came about in response to this crisis. Historically, harm reduction is a collection of public health and social practices that communities engage in to care for each other, intending to reduce the social and physical consequences of drug consumption, regardless of legality. The objective is to see where people stand on drug consumption and meet them there by treating them with compassion.  /  / DanceSafe is a public health non-profit advocacy organization for health and safety in electronic music and nightlife communities. Established in 1998 in the San Francisco Bay Area, DanceSafe was formed after its founder, Emanuel Sferios, discovered a problem with contaminated ecstasy floating in the underground rave scene and a lack of knowledge and resources on the use of MDMA. DanceSafe would, therefore, be established on two fundamental operating principles: harm reduction and peer-based, accessible education. The integration of these two principles has empowered the organization to develop effective peer-based education initiatives to reduce drug addiction and empower young people to make safe, educated lifestyle choices.  /  / Rave Scout Cookies is committed to promoting harm reduction practices, and so for the past year, we have been in the works with DanceSafe National in hopes of expanding on their mission and legacy to different communities and realms out of their collective reach. We are excited to announce our first event, where we join forces to bring on a function filled with informative tips for both ravers and promotors to munch on. /  / SET TIMES AND DANCESAFE NATIONAL NYC PANEL&DISCUSSION: /  / 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM / GAY BAE [ COOKIE SERIES #014: https://soundcloud.com/ravescoutcookies/cookie-series-014-gaybae ] /  / 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM / RAVE SCOUT COOKIES [ https://ravescout.club/ ] / DANCESAFE NATIONAL NYC [ https://dancesafe.org/ ] / DEE DIGGS [ https://soundcloud.com/dee_diggs ] /  / 9:00 PM - 10:00 PM / STARKA [COOKIE SERIES #004: https://soundcloud.com/ravescoutcookies/cookie-series-004-starka ]","6PM - GAY BAE, , 7PM - RAVE SCOUT COOKIES (Salman Jaberi), DANCESAFE NATIONAL, Dee Diggs OPEN TALK AND DISCUSSION , , 9PM STARKA",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1384304,Bossa Nova Civic Club,new york,Nino Picnic Site,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115201858/nino-picnic-site,34.2264,-118.1799,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.69797655', '-73.9279600167073'

925,Marcia Bassett with Barry Weisbl,2/14/2020,"ISSUE presents artist and musician Marcia Bassett’s Out-SIDe PATtern RE-configuration, a new sound and light performance featuring Bassett’s video projections sourced from digitized super 8mm film, liquid light experiments, and video feedback with color gel slide projections by Barry Weisblat. Kyle Eyre Clyd, the longtime moniker of Alabama-based, interdisciplinary artist Kyle Kessler, also presents new work. In late 2019, Bassett released Kyle Eyre Clyd’s Eggshell on her Yew Recordings imprint. /  / Kyle Eyre Clyd presents new work exploring the figure of the medieval artisan as a figure who is not mad but is becoming-mad and in this half-state of identity, addresses the cosmos. The performance features archaic texts of visionaries accompanied by a de-healing drone whose timbres and transitions induce feelings of nausea and simulate auditory hallucinations. Abstracted close-ups, drag, and vocal pitch shifting in video presentation accompany live manipulation of sound. /  / Throughout her artistic practice, Marcia Bassett has sought to induce trance-like-states of mind through her multifaceted audiovisual work. For Out-SIDe PATtern RE-configuration, Bassett explores the interaction of sound and light and their resulting forms, using analog and digital tools and real-time composition to manipulate and abstract sound into seemingly chaotic and fragmented parts. Interrelations between sound and visual projections unfold in timed sequences organized into areas of duration to further emphasize random relationships, abstractions, and conflict. Her visual presentation expands upon an experimental super 8mm film that she shot, edited and composed a soundtrack for in July 2019 titled “Morning Reflections,” plus slide projections from artist Barry Weisblat. /  / Artist/musician Marcia Bassett works in areas of sound, improvisation, live composition and visual creations. Bassett's work is equal parts trance and critique. Her sound pieces thread the needle between the conceptual and the sensual, between ritual invocation and cold semiotic gaze. Using handmade electronic instruments, prepared guitar, synthesizer, field recordings and tape explorations, Bassett deftly wields philosophical systems to produce heady, experiential clouds; pushing through drones into provocative soundscapes – the intangible narratives of dreams. Bassett frequently performs and tours under her solo moniker Zaïmph. As an improviser and sound artist she also frequently joins others in collaborative installations and multimedia projects. Recent collaborative presentations include work with Ursula Scherrer, OptoSonic Tea a site-specific group improvisation and OptoSonic Echoes an 8-channel continuous sound installation and at The Parrish Museum, Water Mill, NY; ""The Eternal Now"" Buchla Music Easel improvisation with Ted Gordon and colorslide stroboscopic light experiments by Jeffrey Perkins at The Diffusion Festival, Baltimore. D.C.; “Survival Of Laments” a live improvisation with Margarida Garcia and Manuel Mota at Festival Oude Muziek 2018, Utrecht, and guitar and violin improvisations with Samara Lubelski. Marcia Bassett's and Samara Lubelski’s LP ’Morning Flare Symmetries’ will be available in 2020 on Feeding Tube Records. Past collaborations and solo projects include work with Andrew Lafkas’ large ensemble Alternate Models; ""Transitory Freezing of Perpetual Motion"" improvised sound performance with Jenny Graf and dancers at Here-10 Evenings Festival, Sweden; “Field Recording with Zaïmph,” BOMB magazine, and ""Out of Line: Narcissister"" live improvised sound interaction with the performance, High Line, NYC. Additionally, she created an original soundtrack for the 2013, Single Channel Video, ""Ten Ways of Doing Time"", written and directed by James Fotopoulos and Laura Parnes. /  / Kyle Eyre Clyd is the longtime moniker of artist Kyle Kessler, an interdisciplinary artist living and working in Birmingham, AL. She has exhibited and performed at the Contemporary Art Center New Orleans, Sculpture Center (NY), Artist Space (NY), ISSUE Project Room (NY), The Stone (NY), PPOW Gallery (NY) and at numerous experimental music festivals. Her music has been played live on WFMU and on small radio stations worldwide. She holds an MFA in Sound from Bard College and a BFA from the Cooper Union. Her sound work is often the result of collaborations with other musicians and thinkers. She has worked with Keith Connolly, Samara Lubelski, Lea Bertucci, Patrick Cole, Dylan Hay, Anthony Saunders, Peter Bowling, and many more. Her new work is a textual and memorial digression from her time spent performing hundreds of shows in the noise underground and its tangential queer communities. It approaches sound from a contemplative, impressionistic perspective and the plastic arts from a conceptual one. Themes may shift on a project-by-project basis but consistently one feels the influence of semiotic interpretations of art punctuated by a haunted delivery and mystic poeticism.","Marcia Bassett with Barry Weisblat, Kyle Eyre Clyd",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1378604,/ Kyle Eyre Clyd,new york,Angeles National Forest Supervisor's Office,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115210435/angeles-national-forest-supervisors-office,34.1481,-118.0338,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.6906095', '-73.98937055'

936,"Golden Record NYC presents Magda, Steve O'Sullivan (Extended Live set), and Morgan",2/15/2020,"This event will be in an intimate venue with strictly limited capacity to ensure the best imaginable vibe and sound that can bend the fabric of space-time. Advanced tickets are strongly recommended. /  / For our first events in the new year, Golden Record NYC shifts gears back to the vibe-y, intimate, underground venues where we started, while maintaining our penchant for the epic lineups with equally epic sound and production we’ve become known and respected for. To start our 2020 series off right, we’ve invited Magda and Steve O’Sullivan, two very different, but equally legendary artists in their respective areas. Steve makes a return to Golden Record for a third time, this time with an extra-extended, three-hour presentation of his hypnotically groovy and precise all-hardware live set. We are thrilled to have Magda for an extended set in an intimate setting on our Hennessey Sound Design system for her Golden Record debut. Our resident Morgan will make her first NYC appearance of 2020 with one of the extra-extended opening sets she’s become known and loved for.  /  / Born in Poland and raised in Detroit, Magda has soaked up the various characteristics of her surroundings, resulting in a widely-cultured perspective. In 1998, she was dropped straight into the deep end; she joined Minus and began touring the world as Richie Hawtin's opening DJ.  / Magda's touring schedule is amongst the most high-profile and demanding around, with regular bookings at many of the world's very best house/techno clubs and festivals. She's proved herself as a consistent, adventurous and top-quality performer, with a knack for bringing tracks together in unexpected ways. She’s also frequently seen DJing b2b sets with fellow Detroit OG Mike Servito, a long-time friend whose deep, intense, and diverse style makes a inimitable match for her own. Golden Record welcomes her for the first time for an extended set to let her spread her diverse tastes and deep experience out for all to hear. /  / A veteran of the mid-90s original phase of minimal house and techno, Steve O’Sullivan is renown for his Mosaic label and his classy, dub-based take on techno and house that earned him the respect of peers and critics ever since. Inspired by Basic Channel’s explorations between house, techno, and dub, Steve’s work falls between sub-genres to focus on subtle depth, beauty and groove; his imprint, Mosaic, follows a similarly diverse path, releasing artists whose music evades strict genre divisions and focuses on quality foremost. Following a now-hallowed period from 1995-2003 on Mosaic and elsewhere, 2008 saw a revival of interest in his accomplishments starting on Berlin’s Sushitech, eventually leading to the full-scale relaunch of Mosaic in 2013 with a bevy of releases from both legends and newer names since. Now again touring with live sets that exemplify the kind of depth and attention to detail his career, Golden Record welcomes his return with a special, very extended live PA sure to show off both the subtlety and drive his music is famed for.  /  / A native of Syndey, Australia, Morgan started DJing in the early 2000s. Her style was born from an enduring curiosity about different styles of music beginning at an early age. Starting out as a hip-hop DJ, she quickly and skillfully segued to another percussive, rhythmic style… house music. Her style was shaped by years spent as a resident DJ in Sydney where she played alongside the likes of Moodymann, Nina Kraviz, Carl Craig and Move D, among others. She then relocated to Europe, spending time living in Bucharest and Barcelona, where she once again established herself, this time in the face of world class competition. Making her production debut on Spanish labels Budare and Sunday Money, her collaborations with Guti earned her international notice, eventually landing them on the Martinez Brothers’ Cuttin’ Headz imprint and establishing her sound, a smart blend of classic house with more modern minimal and techno influenced learned in her decade in DJ booths across the globe. Currently based in New York, Morgan quickly became the resident for our Golden Record NYC events, where she has played alongside Fred P, Sammy Dee, Jus-Ed, Losoul, Daniel Bell, Mike Huckaby and Eddie Fowlkes, to name a few. Her range of experience and fluidity behind the decks is never less than a crowd pleaser, whether she’s opening, playing peak hours or closing.","Magda, Steve O'Sullivan (extended live set), Morgan ",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1377045,TBA - New York,new york,Nino Picnic Site,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115201858/nino-picnic-site,34.2264,-118.1799,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,,

1031,Huxley,2/21/2020,"Andhera Records & Just A Party are pleased to present Huxley at Quantum Brooklyn on February 21, 2020. Join us as we also celebrate the launch of the label, and birthdays of Andhera co-founders Kyle William & Ramsey Neville! /  / Huxley (Toolroom /Knee Deep in Sound/Moon Harbour) /  / It is fair to say that Huxley has fully arrived. Still young but with experiences in the booth and studio well beyond his years, he has a fine array of tools at his disposal. Over the last seven plus years, the friendly character has excelled at many different styles, often ahead of the curve. He does well swung drums as well as bass, main room house and deeper, musically accomplished offerings that stir real emotion. /  / Proof of that lies in his varied and vital discography. Coming on labels like Hypercolour, Tsuba and 20:20 Vision, it includes many club hits and plenty of handy DJ weapons, but also an ambitious and widescreen debut album on Aus Music, which has become a regular home. /  / Always refusing to stay in one sonic niche for too long, Huxley - whether working solo or with close friends like Sam Russo or Ethyl - switches up his sound, tries new things and colours outside the lines with every new outing. Not afraid of a big hook or slaying bassline, he is an artist who unites a variety of sounds, styles and scenes with ease, and always proves as fun as he is well informed. /  / As a DJ, Huxley is someone as comfortable headlining a vast festival stage as he is holding down a small and sweaty basement. He does so from Africa to Australia and is the sort of selector who always delivers a slick, high impact dose of the good stuff. Such is his definitive sense of taste that he continues to lead from the front on his own Rinse FM show. It is there he welcomes exciting guests such as And.ID, Truncate and Vin Sol, and there that you get a wider window into his musical world. /  / The next project on his horizon is No Idea’s Original, an outlet for a wide range of house and techno sounds from Huxley and peers. It has also developed into a party series that has showcased the same sort of fad free, impactful club music that has made Huxley the much loved headline maker he is. /  / www.facebook.com/huxleyofficial/ / www.twitter.com/huxley_music / www.soundcloud.com/huxley_uk","Huxley, Ky William, Ramsey Neville, Christian Bistany, Ethan Harsh, James Wyler",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1362461,Quantum - Andhera Records & Just a Party,new york,Delta Flat Day Use Site,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115205649/delta-flat-day-use-site,34.3034,-118.2596,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.66958775', '-73.9955177593428'

Initially starting as a DJ, Julien Salvi soon found his way to the studio, fine-tuning his own blend of soulful music.  / When his first album Poetry In Motion was released in 2008 his international booking schedule took off, and also gained Redeyes the approval of the most renowned people in the Drum & Bass landscape. Since then he has started working closely with Toulouse based imprint Vandal, releasing his second album Part Of Me in 2013 and more recently, his Memory Lane EP series.  / Although his preferred tempo is provisionally labeled as Drum & Bass, this container concept is too narrow for Redeyes' specific sound. Firmly embedded in Hip-Hop aesthetics and its music and culture, it is only natural his influences are also informed by Jazz, Soul, Funk and Dub. Using this palette in different ways, Redeyes has gained traction from such diverse labels as NinjaTune, Tru Thoughts, Brownswood and The North Quarter.","Redeyes, Adred, Dave Owen",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1369771,Rose Gold,new york,Paul Little Picnic Site,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115201859/paul-little-picnic-site,34.2296,-118.1769,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.7072158', '-73.9319875'

Join us on our debut with Thugfucker and Kevin Saunderson on Feb 22nd @ 260 Meserole Steet, Brooklyn, for an epic experience that will move your soul. Visit our website at www.thephilcorner.com. Come and chill Can’t wait to see you there!  /  / Kevin Saunderson (Origins )  /  / Platinum-selling recording artist, label boss, festival promoter, true innovator in the pantheon of popular music, cultural champion, cracking DJ: there’s a lot to be said about Kevin Saunderson. /  / His influence runs deep, through both adopted hometown of Detroit, and music culture as a whole: as one of the Belleville Three, the high school trio which also includes Juan Atkins and Derrick May, he irreparably changed the face of electronic music; with Inner City, he gave it some of its most memorable tunes.The genesis of today’s enormous techno scene can be retraced straight to Kevin, Derrick and Juan, as their formative experiments on rudimentary hardware sketched a blueprint for a genre that was yet to exist. By absorbing Kraftwerk, cutting-edge funk, local radio stalwart The Electrifying Mojo’s electicism, and all manner of new synthesiser and drum machine-led pop music, the Belleville Three broke new ground as musicians and DJs in the 80s. /  / Saunderson’s comparatively late start as a producer – kicking off in ’87 under the moniker of Kreem, with E-Dancer and Reese two of the more well-known names to follow – inadvertently gifted him a headstart. With the eruption of house music a few hours down the I-94 in Chicago, Saunderson married Detroit’s raw sound to more tactile, pop-leaning sensibilities. Inner City was born, and global success followed.Between “Big Fun”, “Good Life”, debut album Paradise and a number of follow-up singles, Inner City (Saunderson and vocalist Paris Grey) amassed 12 UK top 40 hits and over six million records sold worldwide during their peak. A dancefloor-dominating remix by Luciano in 2008, and a globetrotting reunion tour in 2012, underscores the longevity of Inner City’s classic sound.His nickname of ‘The Elevator’ is apt: for his role in transporting Detroit’s new sound to a wider audience; as anyone who has seen him perform live can attest, his high-energy, high-spirit and high-impact DJ sets; and for spending the past 35 years of his life progressing the culture he helped create.Operating in tandem to his golden run as a producer in the late 80s and early 90s, Saunderson’s own KMS record label – a remarkable 30 years strong in 2017 – has chronicled the early footsteps of R-Tyme, Blake Baxter, MK, Chez Damier, Derrick Carter, Bicep and even Saunderson’s son and regular DJ partner Dantiez more recently. /  / A special 12” series in 2008 called History Elevate, released in tandem with fellow polymath Carl Craig’s Planet E label, brought contemporary names like Mathew Jonson, Simian Mobile Disco and Loco Dice into the fold, proving his nous for fostering relationships with each new wave to come through techno’s gates. 25th anniversary compilations and numerous reissues have followed suit.Saunderson has a behind-the-scenes role to play, too: he is intertwined with the history of Detroit’s flagship Movement (formerly Detroit Electronic Music Festival / Fuse-In). Having produced the event in the mid-2000s, the last handful of years have seen repeated invites from Movement to display his ORIGINS showcase at the festival, bringing acts like Delano Smith, Phuture and DJ Minx under his curatorial umbrella.And of course, with a stacked international touring schedule over the decades, playing in nearly every country and at nearly every festival or club worth mention, he has not stopped pushing the feeling of techno on and on. /  / The Groove That Won’t Stop, indeed. /  / Thugfucker (Life and Death) (VisionQuest )(Music for Freaks) /  / Former international aid worker teams up with Icelandic security specialist and former top model to create an international DJ supergroup. Certainly not what you’d expect from a group called Thugfucker – but then Thugfucker has always managed to defy expectations. /  / One a New Yorker transplanted to Europe, the other an Icelander transplanted to New York. Both from a strong musical background with an almost obsessive dedication to the art of wild party instigation. /  / Growing up on an Icelandic commune full of some of the country’s finest political thinkers, Holmar eschewed his past and all the heady philosophy of his childhood to move to New York and search out more physical and visceral methods of bringing happiness to the masses. /  / Meanwhile Greg was in the midst of a successful (if short-lived) political career in America when he too became disillusioned with the duplicity and self serving interest of those around him. Disturbed by the void he saw in most people’s lives, it was in the dark depths of the New York underground club scene that he finally found his true calling. /  / Unbeknownst to each other, Greg and Holmar then propelled themselves along similar paths, throwing parties, honing their musical & studio skills and searching out inspiration from a wide variety of musical sources. /  / Then one late night, in a cloudy alcohol fueled discussion about the plight of the genetically Rhythm-Blind, Greg and Holmar recognized the depth of their shared passions. Thugfucker was born. /  / When Thugfucker’s single, “Disco Gnome” was released in 2011 it marked the beginning of the highly respected Life and Death label (which Greg co-founded alongside Matteo Milleri and Manfredi Romano) and very quickly, lots of little gnomes were found in the boxes of some of the best DJs worldwide. /  / Disco Gnome received widespread play in all kinds of clubs around the world from DJs as varied as Seth Troxler & the Visionquest crew, Jamie Jones, Guy Gerber, Loco Dice, Sasha, Pete Tong and many many many more. It remains to this day a favorite of clubbers worldwide. /  / Following this came another collaboration with friends and label mates Tale of Us, this time in the form of an EP for Visionquest. With two tracks, “Morgana” and “Step Aside” (featuring Scott McCloud of Girls Against Boys), this collaboration also got lots of love from DJ’s everywhere, went #1 on Beatport, not to mention being named an ‘essential’ track by Pete Tong on his Radio 1 show. /  / And in the meantime Thugfucker continued traveling the globe playing extended back to back DJ sets at some of the best clubs and parties worldwide. From Burning Man to Panorama Bar to Fabric to BPM and Sonar and Coachella to DC10 and Output and Katerholzig and many more. If you haven’t partied with Thugfucker yet then you probably haven’t been trying hard enough to have a good time. /  / Ever evolving, in 2018 Thugfucker saw Holmar departing from the project to pursue other endeavors while Greg continues to keep the Thugfucker fire burning bright as he steers the project upwards and onwards into the future. /  / Thugfucker is currently splitting time between working on new music in the studio and continued traveling and touring worldwide.","Kevin Saunderson ( Origins ), Thugfucker (Life and Death) (VisionQuest)(Music Freaks), Mikey ""LIL'T"" Tello (Michael Tello) (HOUSEPITALITY, BK), , Gavin Stephenson + Iman Rizky (ebb + flow), , Kellam (ebb + flow), , Zallo (World Techno), , KULTECH (SOULFUL SOUNDS) ( THEPHILCORNER), , Fritz Ta (MASHT NYC), , Rodae (SUPPLY & DEMAND) , (THEPHILCORNER)",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1384016,3 Dollar Bill,new york,Inspiration Point Interpretive Site,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115201871/inspiration-point-interpretive-site,34.2215,-118.1094,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.708464', '-73.938172'
1068,Levon Vincent / Tin Man / Justin Cudmore,2/22/2020,"◾️ RSVP: http://bit.ly/BSMTFeb22FB  /  / ◾️ LEVON VINCENT ◾️ If there was a shortlist for the definitive sound of NY dance music, Levon Vincent would easily be on it. From his 2002 debut onwards, Vincent’s productions and DJ sets have set the high water mark for tripping, rough-and-ready immersiveness. His catalogue is littered with absolute classics: “These Games,” “Double Jointed Sex Freak” and “Man or Mistress” on his own Novel Sound, or “Late Night Jam” for Ostgut Ton, just to name a few. Minimal but on-edge, dubby but snarling, unhurried but leading the charge - once you’ve found your way into Vincent’s music, you won’t want to leave. 2019 was as busy a year as ever for him, with shows across Europe, the US and Asia and a standout new album “World Order Music,” which saw him exploring a palette of classic ‘90s NY rave sounds as only he can.  /  / ◾️ TIN MAN ◾️ There’s acid and then there’s Tin Man. Since his debut release “Places” in 2004, Johannes Auvinen has used the Tin Man moniker to explore the Roland 303 with the depth and patience of a painter. In his hands, the squiggly mono sequences of the iconic instrument become invocations of the sublime, his tracks imbued with a monastic focus. His most recent releases on Konstruct, Acid Test and Global A stand as confirmations of his ascetic devotion to the genre. Countless producers play around with squelchy basslines; Tin Man lives it. /  / ◾️ JUSTIN CUDMORE ◾️ Bunker NY bad boy Justin Cudmore is on a tear. Following the release of the snaky club monster “Are You Ready,” he announced Balance, a new residency at Basement, played an uninterrupted slew of sets from Panorama Bar to Mumbai, India and established himself as one of NY’s most in-demand selectors. His recent appearance on Beats in Space shows him in top form, fluently weaving italo synths, jacked up house and humid techno.",Levon Vincent / Tin Man / Justin Cudmore,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1374383,BASEMENT,new york,Echo Mountain Picnic Site,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115201857/echo-mountain-picnic-site,34.2118,-118.1211,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.7152945', '-73.9136973'

Andrew Field-Pickering (AKA Max D) and Ari Goldman have been going back-to-back since the late ’00s, and they’re among the most animated DJs in the game, hammering home the fun and physicality of their selections by dancing and wearing ear-to-ear smiles. They’re also serious record collectors—when they’re not traveling, Goldman and Field-Pickering work in record stores, and their time spent in the bins shows in their sets. Over the years, the duo have used house music as a foundation to explore Baltimore club, jungle, post-punk and other unclassifiable delights. Goldman and Field-Pickering also both share their love of music through the labels they run, World Building and Future Times. /  / Frendzone takes over the Bad Room for the night with Violet. In her home city Lisbon, Violet has contributed to her local scene from different angles; she’s co-founder of online radio station Rádio Quântica and also resident at mina – a queer rave in unexpected venues.

Violet incorporates similar sounds from her production process into her DJing, melding breaks, extraterrestrial jacking rhythms, imaginative techno, acid house and more in a way that feels natural and challenging all at once. /  / +21 /  / *d&b audiotechnik supplied by Oxygen Eventworks* /  / **Good Room is a safe space for all people.

1090,Alvin Lucier: Orpheus Vari,2/22/2020,"ISSUE is pleased to premiere Orpheus Variations, a new composition by revolutionary American composer Alvin Lucier for solo cello, seven wind instruments, and seven dancers. Written for and performed by cellist Charles Curtis and wind ensemble, the piece is staged featuring new choreography from Abigail Levine. The piece is based on a particular sonority, that has haunted Lucier for decades, from the first movement of Igor Stravinsky’s ballet score, Orpheus. The evening also features Lucier’s Glacier for solo cello, also performed by Curtis. /  / Orpheus Variations is one of eight large-scale compositions made expressly for Charles Curtis by Alvin Lucier in the last 15 years. Curtis notes, “Lucier speaks first of a sonority, and only then of a chord. He discusses the chord, its notes and their disposition, but what haunts him is a 'particular sonority.' A sonority is the product of physical action on physical materials: the instruments, the registers in which they are activated, the breath of the musicians, the waveforms thus produced, their merging and interfering, and finally the moment and place of these actions. An energy field, certain to vanish completely once the musicians put down their instruments. However concrete and real the actions and materials, the sonority they produce is a phantom.” /  / In Orpheus Variations, Alvin Lucier arranges the pitches from a single chord of Stravinsky’s Orpheus, itself created as the score for a ballet. The chord is distributed across eight instrumental voices -- seven winds and cello -- who cycle through the pitches, meeting each other in moments of unison and counterpoint. Abigail Levine’s choreography for Orpheus Variations transposes Lucier’s score from sound to gesture. Performed by seven dancers, the choreography is composed with a closed set of seven gestures, which reflect the position, doubling, and progression of the pitches of Stravinsky’s chord. The dancers of the work become, fleetingly, an incarnation of this spectral sound. /  / Abigail Levine has organized an intergenerational group of dancers including Rob Besserer, Elena Demyanenko, Kentoria Earle, Ayano Elson, Maho Ogawa, and Kristopher K.Q. Pourzal. /  / The wind ensemble features students from the University of San Diego under the direction of Charles Curtis: Rachel Allen, Teresa Diaz de Cossio, Nicolee Kuester, Mike Lormand, Michael Matsuno, Alexandria Smith, and Berk Schneider. /  / Written in 2009, Glacier features a cellist slowly sweeping downward, tracking a graph of the mean mass balance of 30 glaciers over a 24-year period, from 1980 to 2004. Glacier was commissioned by Feet to the Fire, Exploring Global Climate Changes from Science to Art and has recently been performed by Curtis with the The Society For The Activation of Social Space Through Art and Sound in Los Angeles, and Lampo in Chicago. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mark Swed describes Glacier as “A quiet piece and a sad one [but also] extremely delicate and endearingly lovely one.” /  / The program observes Lucier’s delicate and lyrical compositional legacy and his enduring engagement with the elusive characteristics of how sound materializes -- with how acoustic mechanics are rediscovered, considered, and performed. Lucier has pioneered many areas of music composition and performance, including the notation of performers' physical gestures, the use of brain waves in live performance, the generation of visual imagery by sound in vibrating media, and the evocation of room acoustics for musical purposes. His sensitivity to sound as a physical phenomenon and his attention to rich aural experience is often practiced through tactical, research-oriented strategies dedicated to contextual listening. A vital figure within experimental music, the compositions of Lucier highlight a general theory of sound, one suggestive of our entangled perceptual position in the sonic world, as well as our attempts to hear the yet-to-be heard. /  / Since the mid-1960s, Alvin Lucier has produced a range of important compositions that have influenced the culture of experimental music and the sonic arts. Early works such as Music for Solo Performer (1965), Vespers (1968), I am sitting in a room (1970), and Bird and Person Dyning (1975) establish a clear thread throughout his long career. Lucier was born in 1931 in Nashua, New Hampshire. He was educated in Nashua public and parochial schools, the Portsmouth Abbey School, Yale, and Brandeis and spent two years in Rome on a Fulbright Scholarship. From 1962 to 1970 he taught at Brandeis, where he conducted the Brandeis University Chamber Chorus, which devoted much of its time to the performance of new music. In 1966, along with Robert Ashley, David Behrman and Gordon Mumma, he co-founded the Sonic Arts Union. From 1968 to 2011 he taught at Wesleyan University where he was John Spencer Camp Professor of Music. Lucier lectures and performs extensively in Asia, Europe and The United States. Recently, Alvin Lucier was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States and received an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from the University of Plymouth, England. Lucier's compositions have been recently featured at ISSUE Project Room including in a two-night retrospective in 2017 and as part of the Sonic Arts Union celebration in 2018*. Lucier was honored at ISSUE's 2018 Gala for his exceptional leadership in the experimental arts communit /  / Called by ArtForum ""one of the great cellists"" as well as ""spellbinding and minimal,"" Charles Curtis has woven a unique career through the worlds of classical performance and musical experimentation. A student of Harvey Shapiro and Leonard Rose at Juilliard and the recipient of the Piatigorsky Prize, upon graduation Curtis was appointed to the faculty of Princeton University. Subsequently he was Principal Cellist of the NDR Symphony Orchestra in Hamburg, where he appeared as soloist with conductors such as Herbert Blomstedt, André Previn, Günter Wand, John Eliot Gardiner and Christoph Eschenbach. Curtis has been guest soloist with the San Francisco Symphony, Baltimore Symphony, National Symphony, Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, Janacek Philharmonic, Orquestra de la Maggio Musicale Florence, and orchestras in Brazil and Chile, among many others. For more than twenty years Curtis has been closely associated with the legendary avant garde composer La Monte Young. As soloist and as director of Young's Theatre of Eternal Music String Ensemble, Curtis has participated in more performances and premieres of Young's music than any other musician. In the last few years Curtis has developed a unique repertoire of major works created expressly for the distinctive qualities of his cello-playing. The great American experimental composer Alvin Lucier has composed numerous works for Curtis, including pieces for cello and sine waves, cello and piano, and cello with large orchestra. French composer Eliane Radigue created her very first work for a purely acoustic instrument for Curtis, the hour-long solo ""Naldjorlak I,"" which Curtis has performed scores of times throughout the world; more recently ""Naldjorlak III"" and ""Occam 5"" have been developed collaboratively with Curtis. Artist and performer Alison Knowles created a unique graphic score for Curtis which has been realized in galleries and alternative settings. These, along with the monumental works of La Monte Young and rarely-heard pieces by Terry Jennings, Richard Maxfield and Morton Feldman, have been championed by Curtis through regular performances and recordings. /  / Abigail Levine is an artist working between New York and Los Angeles. Rooted in dance but moving across media—performance, text, drawing, sound—Levine focuses on the poetics of our body’s work, how we record and value it.

1102,"Deep Space Residency Launch with Francois K, Sub",2/23/2020,"Deep Space returns to earth to launch their residency in the Public Records Sound Room. The lauded, multi-award winning party which was at home at Cielo and Output (RIP) for 15 years, brought trippy vibes and dub-drenched mixes to open-minded dance floor fanatics. Known for its creatively inspired and open-minded inclusion of all music forms that were distantly or directly inspired by dub, the party saw a veritable who’s who’s in guests ranging from disco icons, bass music founders, dub developers and post-modern instigators. Techno, house and Afrobeat had as much of a place on the dancefloor as jazz, Brazilian and the words of great poets. The guests of the party often opted to perform crate-digging, signature “Deep Space” sets that often allowed artists to explore a side of their artistry they typically didn’t get to share.  /  / “I am so excited to share the news that we've decided to start a new Deep Space monthly residency at Public Records in Brooklyn. Ever since Deep Space started in 2003, the party has always felt like the most natural vehicle for me to be able to express my deep love of the dub aesthetic in music, new and old, no matter what form it took. This can only be accomplished in a proper setting, with the right sound system and requires a comfortable and immersive atmosphere which allows our guests to fully become one with the music. We believe that Public Records will be the perfect new home for the continuation of our exploration of the ever-expanding musical cosmos as Deep Space takes place in their Sound Room on Sunday evenings.

1145,Pangaea / Galcher Lustwerk / Lauren Flax,2/28/2020,"◾️ RSVP: http://bit.ly/BSMTFeb28FB  /  / ◾️ PANGAEA ◾️ Kevin McAuley’s career has been defined by mutation. As one third of Hessle Audio (alongside Ben UFO and Pearson Sound), he’s helmed one of the most groundbreaking labels of the era. Hessle shepherded dubstep from its initial turn-of-the-millennium bass bin bleakness into a more startling, cross pollinated sound that splintered across the globe. As Pangaea, McAuley has been an engine of constant reinvention. His earliest releases were some of Hessle’s strongest, reveling in dank atmospherics and a classically-UK sense of longing. Since then, he’s embraced techno’s momentum, minimal’s grooviness, and IDM’s bubbling sense of discovery. 2014’s FABRICLIVE.73 plays with rhythm with an effortless fluency, a masterclass in percussive contrast and cohesion. More recently, tracks like “Cuba Vox” on his own Hadal imprint strip back the fanfare for some breezy rolling. More than ten years after his debut, Pangaea’s explorations refuse to slow down.  /  / ◾️ GALCHER LUSTWERK ◾️ It’s only been six years since Galcher Lustwerk released his “100% Galcher” mix, but its timeless aura of laconic cool and breezy seduction made it an instant classic. Presented by the relatively unknown Blowing Up The Workshop, its 146,000 plays to date dwarf the rest of the series. Lustwerk’s music is a quiet game changer: though he’s influenced many of house music’s most popular young producers, he remains inimitable. There’s a profound sense of mystery behind the simple-but-deadly arrangements and barely-there vocal hooks. This spaciousness gives Lustwerk no place to hide. Nonetheless, you find yourself leaning into the empty pockets in the mix, searching for something. His widely-hailed third LP “Information” was released this past fall on Ghostly International.

Visual artist Jonathan Sims will be providing live projections /  / Born in Evergreen Park, IL in 1984, Anthony Janas. Retired Magician. Boat Captain. Sound Artist with a focus on advanced modular synthesizer techniques and digitally processed field recordings. Member of multimedia group known as Urbe and seminal noise/performance group Panicsville. Contributing artist for the Midwest Society for Acoustic Ecology. Anthony Janas has presented work throughout the United States, Mexico and Western Europe. Anthony Janas work has ranged from sound installations on sailboats to playful performances such as juggling cheeseburgers. Anthony Janas’s work attempts to merge the institutional and pastoral moments of human existence. /  / Jenn Grossman is a sound/experiential media artist concerned with the psycho-spatial possibilities of time-based media, exploring displaced realities, staged synchronicity, cyclical time, collective memory, embodiment/disembodiment, perceptual affect, and transcendent experience. She treats sensory media as a portal into the surreal, subconscious, and otherworldly; through its displacement into everyday settings, objects, and spaces. Her work has taken the form of modular sound sculptures/installations, multichannel sound works, light/projection events, ambient music/soundscapes, video, and public interventions. /  / Jeff Kolar is an independent sound and media artist, composer, and curator. He is the Founder and Artistic Director of Radius, an experimental radio broadcast platform established in 2010. His work, described as “speaker-shredding” (Half Letter Press), “wonderfully strange” (John Corbett), and “characteristically curious” (Marc Weidenbaum), activates sound in unconventional, temporary, and ephemeral ways using appropriation and remix as a critical practice. His solo and collaborative projects, installations, and public performances often investigate the mundane sonic nuances of everyday electronic devices. /  / Jonathan Sims is a New York City based visual artist who originally hails from Texas. His visual arts practice is characterized by brightly colored geometric abstractions and simple, minimalist symbology that evokes language and universal, ancient design. /  / Jonathan began his practice with painting, but has since moved into digital animation, sculpture and projection installations, print, long exposure photography and graphic design. His work is intended to elicit a sense of familiarity and artistic intent in viewers, but his compositions remain stubbornly non-objective, and his fictional “glyph” languages refuse transliteration. A consistent premise underlying his work is based on the idea that a modern human’s relationship with the very ancient past is mirrored in their relationship with the distant future. /  / Past exhibitions include gallery shows and large scale projection installations in San Antonio, Bushwick, Governor’s Island, and upstate New York.","Jeff Kolar, Anthony Janas, Jenn Grossman, Jonathan Sims",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1385836,Flux Factory,new york,Clear Creek Information Station,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115201866/clear-creek-information-station,34.27,-118.1532,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.7526945', '-73.9350915'

He is the co-founder of and a resident at Grounded Theory - perhaps the city’s most prestigious party series for steely, deep techno - a regular at Berghain and a celebrated producer. His sets are delicately structured descents, modulating between power and restraint with an unwavering hand. But his works can speak in a whisper as well as a thunderclap: his most recent EPs on his own Manhigh trade in tantalizing ambiguity and depth of field. / ◾️ VSK (Disconnekt/VSK Series, Berlin) / Italy’s VSK emerged at the dawn of the decade with a powerful mix of heady and acidic sounds, often released on his own Consumer Recreation Services label. Since then, he’s developed across a number of standout releases: ruthless, tunneling, with a touch of the cerebral. Recent works on Mord and Tommy Four Seven’s 47 (2) series show him advancing his voice into new realms—as well as the launch of his new imprint VSK Series. Metal-on-metal synthesis and strobing noise give his high octane sound an extra kick of adrenaline. / ◾️ VOLVOX (Unter/Jack Dept, NYC) / Of the new generation of DJs to emerge from Brooklyn’s recent explosion of club music, Volvox remains one of the most powerful and distinct. Her residencies at Unter and Jack Department are the stuff of legend, and the past year has seen her release her debut production work on Ostgut Ton as she’s quickly made her way to the global stage. Her dirty, acid-drenched sets notoriously steal the show, and 2019 took her across the globe in a whirlwind of performances.  / ◾️ AUSPEX (Dominion/Oath, NYC) / Auspex follows up two years of his party series Dominion with Altær, a new concept developed for Basement. Focusing on bleeding edge techno, this night brings together his most ambitious lineup yet. In his own sets at Unter, Pornceptual, The Black Hole and elsewhere, Auspex pushes dancers to the limit with an unforgiving devotion to air raid intensity and molten sound design. His debut EP “Suspicion” on his own Oath records offers a taste of the mayhem to come. /  / We call into the night…who will answer? /  / Dominion Presents: ALTÆR Guidelines /  / ◾️ FIRST DO NO HARM: We seek to create and maintain a safe and diverse space where consent and respect are our first priorities.

Any behavior that threatens or endangers you, another person, the community or the venue may be considered cause for immediate discharge from the venue. /  / ‍◾️ THE DANCE FLOOR IS A SACRED SPACE: Please keep your phones in your pockets on the dance floor.

From the infamous Roxy to Crobar to the once dominating Pacha NY on 46th Street, Boris maintained a following so devout, so loyal they were truly ‘Believers’.

The trends, they may change but the New York native has stayed true to his drum driven sounds and created his own niche in the wide and vast world of electronic music. Taking bits and pieces from every part of the globe he visits, Boris always maintains a piece of home in his music.  /  / Even though his career spans nearly three decades, the journeyman DJ has yet to falter.

1201,Holland Andrews: Onè,2/29/2020,"2020 ISSUE Artist-In-Residence Holland Andrews presents Onè, a long-form vocal and clarinet performance focused on ancestral trauma, cathartic experience, and, ultimately, healing. With emotionality at the core of their compositional style, Andrews is known for expansive works which weave voice and instrumental performance into massive cathedrals of sound. Moving between haunting and ethereal, to deafening, cathartic discord, the performance is a visceral response to the consequences of a lack recourse and impact from the torture of patriarchal, white supremicist capitalism. /  / Holland describes, “The first program of the year, Onè, is a long-form vocal and clarinet performance sonically retelling the history of my mother's experience losing her twin children at birth from her own perspective, and a message to them and me and my sister that she was never able to share. The loss of her twins was one of the most instrumental events in her life which lead to her death by suicide in 2008 when I was 16 years old. Within this performance I will be exploring the themes of limitless guilt, loss, and shame, but with a twist. Since the program falls on a day where we can ask ourselves, ‘what could we have done differently to change the course of time?’, the performance is also a reprieve of cathartic nurturing which my mother in this space can now share twins before they died at birth.” /  / Holland Andrews is an American vocalist, composer, improviser, and performance artist whose work is based on emotionality in its many forms. In their work, Andrews focuses on the abstraction of operatic and extended-technique voice to build soundscapes encompassing both catharsis and the interplay between dissonance and resonance to tell stories of the interior worlds of humanity. Frequently highlighting themes surrounding vulnerability and healing, Andrews arranges music with voice and clarinet, harnessing the innate qualities of these instruments’ power and elegance to serve as a vessel for these themes. As a vocalist, their influences stem from a dynamic range of musical stylings including contemporary opera, free jazz, musical theater, as well as ambient, drone, and noise music. In addition to creating solo work, Andrews develops and performs the soundscapes for dance, theater, and film, and whose work is still toured nationally and internationally. Andrews has gained recognition from publications such as The New York Times, Uncut Magazine, Electronic Sound, NPR, and more. Holland Andrews is currently based in New York City. Andrews also performs solo music under the stage name Like a Villain, including a performance at ISSUE alongside Tyondai Braxton in 2017.",Holland Andrews,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1378613,Issue Project Room,new york,Nino Picnic Site,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115201858/nino-picnic-site,34.2264,-118.1799,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.6906095', '-73.98937055'

1301,"Nomadic Signals: Porest, Las Sucias",3/6/2020,"2020 Suzanne Fiol Curatorial Fellow Leyya Tawil presents her first program in the NOMADIC SIGNALS series, featuring the NYC debuts of music and performance outlet Porest and Feminist noise reggaeton duo Las Sucias. NOMADIC SIGNALS is a vessel for sonic performance operating in what Tawil refers to as the “diasporic imaginary,” a description of how sounds change in the diaspora: how they tether to their environment, accumulate, synthesize, and adapt at each location. /  / The artists Tawil has brought together for the first NOMADIC SIGNALS use composition and improvisation to address origin, inherency, and borders. They are rigorous with their methods; and pointed with their ancestral references and Babylonian propositions. Together under this umbrella, they contextualize one another and obfuscate the “othering” that often surrounds their work. /  / Porest is the outlet of post-American artist and producer Mark Gergis, a London-based Iraqi-American artist originally hailing from Oakland. Mark Gergis is a storyteller of dystopic currents; his shows are radio-like, as he streams between distorted Syrian rhythms, audio samples of otherlands and absurdist commentary. Las Sucias, the Oakland-based duo of Danishta Rivero and Alexandra Buschman-Román, use voice, synths, and live manipulations that shapeshift the room into a femmenoise vortex that accesses their Puerto Rican and Venezuelan spirits. /  / For decades, Porest has issued a trail of confounding agitprop sound art, post-globalized hate-pop, diabolical radio dramas, big songs and small songs. Porest’s blatant embezzlement of human syntax and cultural misunderstanding broadcasts vital mixed messages across all fields, forging carefully rearranged realities that both avoid and indulge the inherent trappings of radical art and politics. Live performances integrate Porest’s music, performance and sound into a grand total sum that can’t be unseen. Porest has performed and toured worldwide, with albums released on Nashazphone (Cairo), Discrepant (UK), and in the US on the Seeland, Abduction and Resipiscent labels. In the 1990s and 2000s, Mark was co-founder of the long-running experimental performance collective Mono Pause, as well as its offshoot Neung Phak. In his other life, Mark is an archivist and producer for global music releases on the Sublime Frequencies and Sham Palace labels, including compilations and documentary works such as I Remember Syria, Cambodian Cassette Archives, Saigon Rock & Soul, Choubi Choubi (Iraq), Dabke: Sounds from the Syrian Houran and his extensive work with artists Omar Souleyman (Syria) and Erikin Koray (Turkey). /  / Tropical Noise Duo Las Sucias is an Experimental Caribbean Cacophony from the hands and lungs of hysterical brujas Danishta Rivero and Alexandra Buschman-Román, from Venezuela and Puerto Rico respectively. Rooted on Santería, Afro-Caribbean and Mestiza consciousness, through hybrid rhythms that include Raggaetón and Cumbia, Las Sucias booty smashes the limits put upon the brown female body by the patriarchy. Through powerful chanting and ritualistic vocal catharsis, they conjure the unapologetic screams of a loca, the deep-voiced lady screaming bible verses in the streets through a broken mic and the wounded voices of the colonized.” - Hildegard Von Bingen /  / Alexandra Buschman-Román is a ground shaking radical Sound Artist, Composer, Vocalist, Percussionist and Improviser from Carolina, Puerto Rico, now based mostly in Oakland, CA. Most of her work has been around de-colonization of Noise music and sound experimentation, deconstruction of the traditional and folk, and the fusion of the old and the new. Her mission is to bridge sounds, cultures, space and time - reconnect the diaspora with the motherland, create spaces for marginalized and colonized artists, and glue communities together, all through sociopolitical radicalization of sound and music spaces. /  / Danishta Rivero is an improviser, performer, and sound artist originally from Venezuela, based in Oakland, California. She explores the artifacts resulting from heavy processing of the voice and their relationship to its acoustic resonating presence. She embodies this relationship to create visceral, sonic rituals. As a soloist, Rivero often performs as Caribay, conjuring the eponymous mountain spirit, whose laments cause avalanches. She is a member of electro-acoustic duo Voicehandler with percussionist Jacob Felix Heule.","Porest, Las Sucias",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1378615,Issue Project Room,new york,Inspiration Point Interpretive Site,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115201871/inspiration-point-interpretive-site,34.2215,-118.1094,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.6906095', '-73.98937055'

1385,Ben Vida: Always Already with Yarn/Wire & Nina Dante / Aaron David Ross: Filter Failure,3/12/2020,"As part of a series of celebratory events at ISSUE’s 22 Boerum theater, Thursday, March 12th, ISSUE presents the New York premiere of Always Already, a new commissioned work by Ben Vida performed by renowned quartet Yarn/Wire, vocalist Nina Dante, and Vida himself. Previously both ISSUE Artists-In-Residence, this is the first ever collaborative project between Vida and Yarn/Wire. The evening also features the ISSUE debut of New York based composer Aaron David Ross (ADR), presenting new compositions from his unreleased Filter Failure song cycle, accompanied by self-made animations. /  / Always Already is a text based composition for electronics, voice and ensemble. It is a hypnotic examination of the materiality of language that emphasizes the rhythm of speech through repetition and variation. Composed and performed by Ben Vida with Nina Dante and Yarn/Wire, this new work expands on the compositions for small vocal ensembles which Vida has presented at such venues as the Kitchen and BAM. /  / Always Already is the first of these pieces to include live instrumentalists. Keyboards, marimbas, electronics and voices are braided together to produce a mesmerizing ramble of language and notes. The works abstract narrative was developed out of a dense cyclical text which was inspired by the rhythmical essays of Gertrude Stein, the Gysin/Burroughs cut-up method and the parsing systems of the Conceptual Writers. /  / Following acclaimed releases Deceptionista and Throat on PAN, ADR’s new solo work Filter Failure takes the form of a cinematic song cycle, featuring ten animated tone-poems which showcase ADR not only as a cybernetic singer-songwriter, but also as a 3D-hobbyist animator. The first project to ever feature ADR’s voice and lyrics, each song serves as the basis for a surrealist visual rendering that showcase avatar-driven lip-synced adventure-scenarios guided by ADR’s affect-driven compositional approach. Often maneuvering between multiple genres and contexts, either through his duo project Gatekeeper, or his productions with Ryan Trecartin, Lafawndah, Telfar, and others, ADR is known for a breadth of vision underpinned by a consistently beguiling, skillful production style. In the past, this exploration has existed between monikers; however, with his recent work, it’s between songs or even seconds of time -- all balancing precariously between embracing and rejecting the overwinding digital time-scales and narrative degeneration we endure as 21st century citizen-users. /  / Before the long-awaited renovation of our 22 Boerum theater begins in April, ISSUE presents a special series of events that reflect on the organization’s trajectory as a home for experimental performance. Featuring artists from across our history as well as new projects, these events mark a milestone moment to celebrate in the theater and support ISSUE as we embark on a period of off-site programming. Join us in bringing commissions, premieres, and rare performances to new contexts and spaces throughout New York City. /  / Ben Vida is a composer and artist. In the mid-1990s Vida co-founded the minimalist quartet Town & Country and released solo records under the moniker Bird Show. He has worked with numerous labels including Shelter Press, PAN, Root Strata and Kranky. His work has been featured in Artforum, Modern Painters, The Paris Review, The New York Times, Art Review, Wire Magazine, The Creators Project, WIRED Magazine among others. His pieces have been presented widely in venues such as the Guggenheim, NYC; GRM/INA, France; Centro Pecci in Prato, Italy; STUK in Leuven, Belgium; the MCA, Chicago; The ICA, London; The Kitchen, NYC; Performa Biennial, NYC; EMPAC, Troy, NY; Leap Gallery, Berlin; Lampo, Chicago; Cricoteka Museum, Kraków, Poland; the Sydney Opera House; Museo d’Arte Moderna di Bologna; Borderline Festival, Athens, Greece; the Royal Festival Hall, London and the Brooklyn Academy of Music, NY. Vida teaches in the MFA program in Sonic Arts at Brooklyn College. /  / Yarn/Wire is a New York-based percussion and piano quartet comprised of Ian Antonio, Laura Barger, Russell Greenberg, and Ning Yu. This instrumental combination allows the ensemble flexibility to slip effortlessly between classics of the repertoire and modern works that continue to forge new boundaries.Founded in 2005 while at Stony Brook University, Yarn/Wire is admired for the energy and precision they bring to performances of today's most adventurous music. The results of their collaborative initiatives with genre-bending artists such as Two-Headed Calf, Pete Swanson, and Tristan Perich point towards the emergence of a new and lasting repertoire that is ""spare and strange and very, very new."" (Time Out NY). Yarn/Wire is dedicated to expanding the repertoire written for its instrumentation, through commissions and collaborative initiatives that aim to build a new and lasting body of work. Influenced by its members’ experiences with classical music, avant-garde theatre, and rock music, the ensemble champions a varied and probing repertoire. /  / Soprano/vocalist Nina Dante is a soloist, chamber musician, improviser and composer based in New York City. Musical experimentation and the continual discovery of the voice’s technical ability and emotive power are the inspiring forces behind her work. Hailed for her “amazing performance of vocal versatility by a uniquely gifted young artist” (Chicago Classical Review), Dante has performed at Resonant Bodies Festival, BAM, Lampo, Issue Project Room, Roulette, the Kitchen, National Sawdust, the University of Chicago’s Contempo, Performa, Indexical, Visiones Sonoras, Museo Universitario de Arte Contemporaneo, the Experimental Sound Studio, New Music Miami, the Latino Music Festival, the Frequency Festival, Festival Interfaz, the Poetry Foundation, and the Renaissance Society, among others. /  / Aaron David Ross (ADR) is a composer, producer and artist preoccupied with music’s affective potentiality. In addition to his work as one half of the critically acclaimed Gatekeeper duo and touring as a member of Oneothrix Point Never’s Myriad ensemble, ADR releases solo recordings, hosts an array of ongoing collaborations, composes for film, tv and advertising, and maintains a practice of live performance and sound installation. As a recording artist, Aaron has released music with renowned independent labels PAN (DE), Warp (UK), Hippos in Tanks (US), Kompakt (DE), Merok (UK), Public Information (UK), and Presto (IT). He has performed at many of the world’s premiere concert venues, clubs and festivals, and has been featured and reviewed in publications including The New York Times, NPR, Art Forum, The Guardian, Dazed & Confused, Pitchfork, Art In America, The Fader, Interview, FACT, and many others. His installed collaborative works have been exhibited at biennials, galleries and museums internationally, including at the Whitney Biennial (US), Venice Biennale (IT), Saatchi Gallery Paris (FR), The DeYoung San Fransisco (US), MoMA New York (US), MCA Chicago (US), and more. His original film scores have premiered in globally celebrated festivals and programs including Festival del film Locarno in Switzerland, Berlin Biennale in Germany, Migrating Forms at BAM in New York, Biennale de l’Image en Mouvement in Geneva, and Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York. Originally from Tucson, AZ, Aaron received a BM in composition from Columbia before pursuing an MFA in Sound Art & Music Technology from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He now lives and works in New York City.","Ben Vida with Yarn/Wire & Nina Dante, Aaron David Ross",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1392859,Issue Project Room,new york,Eugene O'neill National Historic Site,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115208078/eugene-oneill-national-historic-site,37.8265,-122.0267,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.6906095', '-73.98937055'
1386,Maryanne Amacher: Living Sound,3/12/2020,"Throughout her life, Maryanne Amacher exercised an exemplary sensitivity and care for the ways in which her work was presented. This care is both that which exceptionally distinguishes her practice, and that which has kept it from circulating through many conventional distribution channels. Now, 10 years after Amacher’s passing, her materials have found a permanent home where traces of the complex, elusive “whole” of her oeuvre will, over the next few years, finally become accessible to researchers and to the public. Join us in celebrating this momentous occasion at The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts on March 12th. For this special occasion, Bill Dietz & Amy Cimini will present a selection of original archival documents (writings, scores), objects (artworks, audio gear), and sounds (newly digitized audio) — just a small sampling of the collection’s soon to be accessible breadth.  /  / Maryanne Amacher (1938 – 2009) was a composer of large-scale fixed-duration sound installations and a highly original thinker in the areas of perception, sound spatialization, creative intelligence, and aural architecture. She is frequently cited as a pioneer of what has come to be called “sound art,” although her thought and creative practice consistently challenges key assumptions about the capacities and limitations of this nascent genre. Often considered to be a part of a post-Cagean lineage, her work anticipates some of the most important developments in network culture, media arts, acoustic ecology, and sound studies.","Maryanne Amacher, Bill Dietz, Amy Cimini",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1398137,New York Public Library,new york,Kirby Cove Campground,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115195250/kirby-cove-campground,37.8403,-122.4889,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'42.7976632', '-73.9527343'

1446,Lary 7 / John Krausbauer & Kaori Suzuki,3/14/2020,"ISSUE presents composer and multi-instrumentalist John Krausbauer in collaboration with Tokyo-born composer Kaori Suzuki. Intensely ritualistic, the duo’s free drone music originates from a shared interest in ecstatic and spiritual musics. The inimitable Lary 7 performs a live version of his “droney tone” film piece, an unrepeatable sound and light “rewind” piece which borrows from the arcane technological worlds of film, light, and sound mechanisms combined to create a hypnotic environment. /  / For the first time in New York, John Krausbauer and Kaori Suzuki present their free ecstatic durational music for voices, amplified strings, electronics, and bell percussion. High-volume, sustained tones, and stroboscopic lighting build a collective, radiating, ur-drone in exploration of psychotropic sensorial experience. /  / Lary 7’s “droney tone” piece is a hybridization of the worlds of film editing (rewinds) and repurposed light sensor tubes originally intended as synchronizers for photo studio flashbulbs. The technology converts light into very detailed sound textures, functioning as a microscope for sound. The light source is derived from two strobotac laboratory oscillator-driven neon tubes originally designed under contract of Harold Eugene Edgerton, known as “Papa Flash,” the inventor of the modern day strobe in the 1930s. The result of this highly technical unison technologies is quite hypnotic, atmospheric, and, in Lary’s words “pretty hard to describe without seeing-hearing.” /  / Born in Buffalo, New York, Lary 7 is a multimedia artist who coaxes profane, inscrutable sounds and images from various mysterious devices. Eschewing the digital, his work mainly features vintage and forgotten electronic instruments and technologies. In the past he has taken the unique approach of modifying household appliances in order to give them a musical voice. Lary is a co-founder of Plastickville Records and has been a major figure in the New York experimental underground music scene since 1970. He has worked on exceptional musical projects with diverse artists including Jimi Tenor, Jarboe, Foetus, Tony Conrad, Alexander Hacke, Larry Mullins, Dorit Chrysler, Bernhard Gal, Jacob Kirkegaard, Gen Ken Montgomery, and Gordon Monahan. In 2016, ISSUE commissioned Lary 7 to create Owl Movie, his first-ever fixed media film. /  / John Krausbauer is a composer/multi-instrumentalist/artist based in Oakland, CA and co-founder of the Los Angeles publishing label, Besom Presse. A long time purveyor of the ur-drone and trance-psychedelia, his compositional work involves audio transmissions for TOTAL/immersive experience. Transcendence through repetition, duration, alternate tunings, maximum volumes, and stroboscopic lighting. In recent years he has returned to improvisational playing and sought out particular collaborations to further explore his interest in improvisatory music making. He has performed and presented his music across N America, Europe, and Japan in a multitude of settings - from basements, sidewalks, and rock clubs to colleges, churches, and art museums. Over 20 recordings of his have been released on independent labels in the US, Europe, and Japan. His group and solo music can be found on Important, Beta-Lactam Ring, ANTS, Fabrica, Debacle, Autumn, Thin Wrist (upcoming), and a number of other international labels. His current music projects include the Ecstatic Music Band (a 10+ member-collective of strings players); solo music for amplified violin and tape; his collaboration with partner, Kaori Suzuki, with bells, voices, strings, electronics; the Minimalist psych-punk group Night Collectors; his systems-based phase compositions; as well as past and ongoing duo collaborations with Louisville resonator guitarist R. Keenan Lawler, NYC bagpiper David Watson, and Tokyo guitarist Tetuzi Akiyama. /  / Kaori Suzuki is a Tokyo-born music maker/composer living in Oakland, CA. Her spiraling sound visions often take form in long durations, using electroacoustic sound technologies, high-register electronics, modified acoustic instruments, and tape. She seeks to create heightened listening states, emphasizing finding ‘music’ within activated space-time. She has toured and performed her music in numerous venues and settings across the US, Japan, Europe, Mexico, and Canada, and has released her music on independent labels in Germany and the US. Her current projects include her solo compositions involving modified instruments and electronics; drumming in the Oakland-based Minimalist psych-punk group Night Collectors; playing cello and guitar in the Ecstatic Music Band; her durational music for vhf-combination tones; and on-going collaborations with John Krausbauer in immersive light/sound happenings.","Lary 7, John Krausbauer & Kaori Suzuki",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1378618,Issue Project Room,new york,Echo Mountain Picnic Site,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115201857/echo-mountain-picnic-site,34.2118,-118.1211,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.6906095', '-73.98937055'

1576,Jacob Kirkegaard: Opus Autopsia / Lyria Pramuk: Foutain,3/24/2020,"As part of a series of celebratory events at ISSUE’s 22 Boerum theater, Tuesday, March 24th, ISSUE presents sound artist Jacob Kirkegaard performing work from his Opus Mors series. The evening also features musician Lyra Pramuk, performing the North American debut of material from her album Fountain, set to be released on March 20th via Iceland’s Bedroom Community label. Entrance is free for ISSUE Members. /  / Known for presenting complex, unnoticed or unapproachable conditions and environments, Jacob Kirkegaard returns to ISSUE to perform a piece from his recent Opus Mors project, a powerfully detailed sonic meditation into four significant death processes rendered as listening spaces. The series portrays four sound environments that the human body commonly will be surrounded by or exposed to in the immediate post mortem: a morgue, an autopsy, a cremation and the decomposition -- events that no one can physically experience because of the very fact of death. At ISSUE, Kirkegaard presents one piece from the series, Opus Autopsia, featuring detailed and precise near-field sound recordings of a full autopsy starting with opening the corpse, following the removal and slicing and cutting open all the organs and brain, to finally returning all the organs, closing and washing the corpse. Released as a part of a 4 LP set of the full cycle of work, Opus Autopsia is presented alongside an expansive “track list” that provides insight into the timbre of the unique human organs. Limited copies of this rare edition will be available at the performance. /  / Lyra Pramuk presents the North American debut of material from her upcoming album Fountain, a song cycle created entirely from her own voice, although often shaped and structured by electronics. The title is derived from her family name, Pramuk, which translates from Czech as “well spring” or “fountain.” Often wordless, these songs evoke the ritual force of drowning, immersion, cleansing, and bathing -- also referred to in the album artwork by acclaimed visual artist Donna Huanca. Fountain approaches rhythms, speech, body, and the relation between technology and humanity, thematically exploring a post-human, non-binary understanding of life and the fragile ecosystems it depends on. As a vocal activist and member of the queer community, Fountain’s creation also coincided with a personal rejuvenation for its author. Its completion culminated in the live premiere of the album material at Unsound Festival in Krakow in 2019, where she performed through a multi-channel array designed by Ben Frost, opening for Sunn O))) and Roly Porter. /  / Before the long-awaited renovation of our 22 Boerum theater begins in April, ISSUE presents a special series of events that reflect on the organization’s trajectory as a home for experimental performance. Featuring artists from across our history as well as new projects, these events mark a milestone moment to celebrate in the theater and support ISSUE as we embark on a period of off-site programming. Join us in bringing commissions, premieres, and rare performances to new contexts and spaces throughout New York City. /  / The sound art of Jacob Kirkegaard explores ways to reflect on complex, unnoticed or unapproachable conditions and environments. His works have treated themes such as radioactivity in Chernobyl and Fukushima, melting ice in the Arctic, and border walls in Palestine. His two recent works are immersive acoustic explorations into global waste management and of processes generally unfolding when a human being dies. Since 2006 Kirkegaard been extensively researching, recording and creating works using otoacoustic emissions; tones generated from the actual human ear. The core element and method of his work derives from the use of sound recordings of the tangible aspects from its intangible themes. Kirkegaard has presented his works at galleries, museums, biennales and concert spaces throughout the world, including MoMA in New York, LOUISIANA - Museum of Modern Art and ARoS in Denmark, The Menil Collection and at the Rothko Chapel in Houston, The Sydney Biennale in Australia, Aichi Triennale in Nagoya, the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo, Japan. Jacob Kirkegaard has gallery representation through Fridman Gallery (New York, USA) and Galleri Tom Christoffersen (Copenhagen, DK). His work is represented in the permanent collection of LOUISIANA - Museum of Modern Art in Denmark. Kirkegaard's sound works have been released on labels such as Important Records (USA), Touch (UK), mAtter (JAP) and Posh Isolation (DK). He is a founding member of the sound art collective freq_out as well as the not-for-profit arts organisation TOPOS. In 2016 Kirkegaard was the sound-artist-in-residency at St. John's College, University of Oxford, U.K. www.fonik.dk /  / Lyra Pramuk fuses classical training, pop sensibilities, performance practices and contemporary club culture in what may best be described as futurist folk music. While the American operatically-trained vocalist and electronic musician is perhaps previously best known for her work with musical collaborators such as Holly Herndon and Colin Self, she is set to release her debut album, Fountain, via Iceland’s Bedroom Community label in March 2020. Collaborations with the visual artist Donna Huanca, freelance writing projects, and an ongoing international performance schedule, are part of a variety of creative nodes that feedback into Lyra’s practice. Lyra moved to Berlin in 2013 as a DAAD postgraduate study scholarship recipient, following her degree at the Eastman School of Music in New York. Since then, she has also been awarded residencies at Elektronmusikstudion EMS Stockholm, Open Port Club Residency in Tokyo and Sapporo, and Future Music Lab of the Atlantic Music Festival in Maine. Her interests also encompass writing, poetry, and fashion, where she is sometimes called upon as a model. As a performance artist, she has collaborated extensively with Donna Huanca and at events such as Glasgow International and the Rochester Fringe Festival.","Jacob Kirkegaard, Lyra Pramuk",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1392861,Issue Project Room,new york,Inspiration Point Interpretive Site,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115201871/inspiration-point-interpretive-site,34.2215,-118.1094,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.6906095', '-73.98937055'

1590,George Lewis: Recombinant Works 2014-2019,3/26/2020,"As part of a series of celebratory events at ISSUE’s 22 Boerum theater, Thursday, March 26th, ISSUE is pleased to present an evening of recent electroacoustic works from visionary composer, trombonist, and scholar George Lewis. Known for his astonishing level of creativity and expansive critiques of many traditional conceptions about experimental music, Lewis has charted new ground in the fields of improvisation, interactive music, nonhierarchical collaboration, and computer music. Lewis has also worked as a trombonist in bands for years, served as a curator at The Kitchen, developed Voyager (an early and groundbreaking software capable of improvising with live performers), and authored a monumental history of the AACM (Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians). /  / At ISSUE, Lewis presents a “portrait concert” of four recent works performed by musicians Laura Cocks, Seth Parker Woods, Dana Jessen, Conrad Harris & Pauline Kim. All four of these “recombinant” works use software to draw from acoustic sounds to create multiple digitally created sonic personalities that follow diverse yet intersecting spatial trajectories. The software for all four works was written by Dr. Damon Holzborn. /  / Emergent, written for flutist Claire Chase, is the first in this series. Here, the delays, trajectories, and timbre transformations combine to create a musical dance of agency. Although the work does not deploy explicit models of self-similarity, the more immediate spatial trajectories expand into larger trajectories of analogous affect across the progress of the piece. /  / Not Alone, the second work in the series, was written for cellist Seth Parker Woods. The electronics and the cello blend, intersect, and ultimately diverge into multiple digital personalities that can suddenly converge into unified ensembles while shrouding their origin in processes of repetition. The composition is dedicated to cellist Abdul Wadud, one of the leading members of the Black Artist Group. /  / Seismologic, the third piece in the series, was written for bassoonist Dana Jessen, with inspiration from the musically oriented seismologist Ben Holtzman of Columbia University. Here, foreground and background deliberately conflate, and delays are used create Doppelgängers that blur the boundaries between original and copy, or even transform the bassoon into an ultra-contrabassoon. /  / Memory/Mutation, written for the duo String Noise (Conrad Harris and Pauline Kim), is the latest in the series, and the first to feature more than one acoustic instrumentalist. Listeners might be surprised to hear that this piece was inspired by the duo’s extraordinary performance at Ostrava Days 2017 of an Alvin Lucier work for two violins. /  / PROGRAM: / Emergent (2014), for flute and electronics / Laura Cocks, flute /  / Not Alone (2014-15), for cello and electronics / Seth Parker Woods, cello /  / Intermission /  / Seismologic (2017), for bassoon and electronics / Dana Jessen, bassoon /  / Memory/Mutation (2019), for two violins and electronics / String Noise: Conrad Harris and Pauline Kim, violins /  / Before the long-awaited renovation of our 22 Boerum theater begins in April, ISSUE presents a special series of events that reflect on the organization’s trajectory as a home for experimental performance.

Lewis’s other honors include a MacArthur “genius” Fellowship (2002), a Guggenheim Fellowship (2015), and the Doris Duke Artist Award (2019). A member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) since 1971, Lewis's work in electronic and computer music, computer-based multimedia installations, and notated and improvisative forms is documented on more than 150 recordings. His work has been presented by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, Ensemble Dal Niente, Ensemble Intercontemporain, London Philharmonia Orchestra, Talea Ensemble, International Contemporary Ensemble, Musikfabrik, Mivos Quartet, London Sinfonietta, Spektral Quartet, and others; his opera Afterword (2015) has been performed in the United States, United Kingdom, and the Czech Republic.

1619,Laurie Spiegel: 'A Harmonic Algorithm' in Collabor,3/28/2020,"As part of a series of celebratory events at ISSUE’s 22 Boerum theater, Saturday, March 28th, ISSUE presents electronic music pioneer Laurie Spiegel’s piece A Harmonic Algorithm 2011 in collaboration with Seth Cluett. The third incarnation of a work first created through a computer algorithm coded by Spiegel, the piece is spatialized by Cluett, Artist-in-Residence at Nokia Bell Labs. The evening also features Milan-based composer Caterina Barbieri presenting new work for the first time at ISSUE. /  / Laurie Spiegel’s A Harmonic Algorithm 2011 is the third incarnation of a series of algorithms that Spiegel first coded on her Apple II computer around 1980. In her program notes for the piece, Spiegel notes, “At Bell Labs, it had occurred to me [...] that if a composer creates individual ‘pieces of music’ that at the end of his/her life there will only be a finite number of musical works by that composer. If instead of composing individual finite length works, a composer could encode in computer software their personal compositional methods, preferences, processes and ways of making musical decisions, and somehow their aesthetic sensibility too, then they could go on composing and generating new music long after the biological human had ceased to exist.” /  / She continues, “In figuring out this particular logic, I spent a lot of time studying the harmonic progressions in Bach's Chorals, on which I based this software. I had happened upon a wonderful used book, ""The Contrapuntal Harmonic Technique of the 18th Century"" (Allen Irvine McHose, 1947) that was extremely helpful to me while figuring out the logic I coded into these algorithms. (A compositional algorithm is basically just a set of rules, a description in an artificial computer language of a process of decision-making, a sort of a written ‘score’ that embodies a procedure for composing, except that instead of humans playing from that score, a machine does.)” /  / Working in dialogue with Spiegel on the multi-channel loudspeaker array at Bell Labs, Seth Cluett will create a new diffusion of the work that will take advantage of the unique acoustics of 22 Boerum Place. /  / At ISSUE, Caterina Barbieri performs her own distinct style of pattern-based synthesizer music. Barbieri explores themes related to machine intelligence and object-oriented perception in sound through a focus on minimalism. Following 2017’s acclaimed 2LP “Patterns of Consciousness”, Barbieri recently released “Ecstatic Computation,” a new full-length LP on Editions Mego. The album revolves around the creative use of complex sequencing techniques and pattern-based operations to explore the artefacts of human perception and memory processes by ultimately inducing a sense of ecstasy and contemplation. Computation is turned from being a formal, automatic writing technique into a creative, psychedelic practice to generate temporal hallucinations. Equally nervous and ecstatic, the fast permutation of patterns can create a state where time stands still whilst simultaneously being in motion -- where the perception of the present is constantly refreshed, in an endless sense of loss, re-discovery and the search for self-orientation. /  / Composer Laurie Spiegel's music draws on her classical training, pre-classical lute, and folk guitar and banjo roots; however, she is also a computer programmer, software designer, visual and video artist, and a published theorist. She is known for her pioneering work with several early electronic and computer music systems, focusing largely on interactive software that uses algorithmic logic to supplement and extend human abilities, and on the aesthetics of musical structure and cognitive process. Spiegel's visual works­—computer graphics, video, drawings, and photography—have been exhibited in the United States, Europe, and Japan. She has directed computer and electronic music studios and taught composition at Cooper Union and at New York University, where she founded its first computer music studio. Her realization of Johannes Kepler's Harmony of the Planets was sent into space as the opening cut of the Voyager Spacecraft's record Sounds of Earth (1977). Spiegel's recorded works have been available on 1750 Arch, Capriccio, Philo, Unseen Worlds, and other labels. Her computer software for music, such as Music Mouse—An Intelligent Instrument­ (1986), has been published for Amiga, Atari, and Macintosh computers. Spiegel has received fellowships and grants from the New York State Council on the Arts, ASCAP, and the Experimental Television Lab at WNET, among others. She is a freelance composer for film, dance, and other media, as well as a writer, software developer, visual artist, and a consultant in computer music, audio software design, and in other areas of information technology. Spiegel's studies include an A.B. from Shimer College and an M.A. from Brooklyn College, and additional studies at Oxford and Juilliard. /  / Seth Cluett is a composer and visual artist who creates work that explores everyday actions at extreme magnification, examines minutae by amplifying impossible tasks, and tries to understand the working of memory in forms that rethink the role of the senses in an increasingly technologized society. Ranging from photography and drawing to installation, concert music, and critical writing, his “subtle…seductive, immersive” (Artforum) sound work has been characterized as “rigorously focused and full of detail” (e/i) and “dramatic, powerful, and at one with nature” (The Wire). The recipient of grants from Foundation for Contemporary Arts Emergency Fund and Meet the Composer, his work has been presented internationally at venues such as The Whitney Museum, MoMA/PS1, Moving Image Art Fair, CONTEXT Art Miami, GRM, and STEIM. His concert work has been commissioned by ensembles ranging from the Hong Kong Sinfonietta and the International Contemporary Ensemble to So Percussion, Catch Guitar Quartet, and Clogs and is documented on Line, Sedimental, Notice, and Winds Measure recordings. Cluett is the Assistant Director of the Computer Music Center and Sound Art Program at Columbia University and is Artist-in-Residence with Experiments in Art and Technology at Nokia Bell Labs where he maintains a studio and is active in research on virtual and augmented reality acoustics and multi-sensory communication. More information: http://www.sethcluett.com /  / Caterina Barbieri (b.1990, Bologna, Italy) is an Italian composer who explores themes related to machine intelligence and object-oriented perception in sound through a focus on minimalism. She is interested in the polyphonic and polyrhythmic potential of synthesizers to draw complex geometries in space and time. Barbieri holds a diploma in classical guitar and a bachelor's degree in electroacoustic music from the conservatory of Bologna, Italy, alongside a bachelor's degree from the Faculty of Humanities and Philosophy of Bologna with a thesis in Ethnomusicology about Hindustani music and minimalism.Since 2013 she has researched and produced music at Elektronmusikstudion in Stockholm, where she has intensively composed for the Buchla 200 system. She has performed at MaerzMusik and Berlin Atonal, Mutek, Unsound, Sonar, Primavera Sound, Barbican Centre, Philharmonie de Paris, CTM, Ableton Loop, Moogfest and La Biennale di Venezia. Her 2017 2LP Patterns of Consciousness was named in several “best of” music round-ups. In 2019 Barbieri released the LP Ecstatic Computation on Editions Mego.

Yet when American musicologist Brian Shimkovitz stumbled upon the tape at a street stall in Cape Coast, Ghana eight years later, it became the stimulus for him to launch the Awesome Tapes from Africa blog. As he wrote in his inaugural post: “This is it. The song is called ‘Moma Yendodo.’ You may never hear anything like this elsewhere. No one I know in Ghana listens to this frenetic leftfield rap madness.” /  / The music on the recording—an amalgam of highlife, Twi language rap, funk, hip-hop, and electronica—traverses a pop music landscape that encapsulates international modes while reflecting contemporary Ghanaian music of the period. Presented with the sweaty passion of a Prince record and the lo-fi recording charm of early Chicago house music, Obaa Sima's joyous soul and casual brilliance made the enigmatic Ata Kak an underground internet sensation and party-starter the world over. After more than a decade of searching, Brian finally tracked down the singer and released the LP officially in March 2015. /  / “Its positive shine, relentless energy, and alien earworm choruses feel like a portal to an alternate reality, where the sounds of South Africa’s Shangaan electro, Mali’s Balani Show, Syria’s dabke, British grime, and Portuguese kuduro all sweat together.” – FACT Magazine /  / Tags",Ata Kak,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1360870,Pioneer Works,new york,Angeles National Forest Supervisor's Office,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115210435/angeles-national-forest-supervisors-office,34.1481,-118.0338,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.679378', '-74.011894'

1812,The Polish Ambassador & Friends fe,5/8/2020,"The Polish Ambassador & Friends ft. Nitty Scott w/ saQi /  / Date: Friday, May 8th, 2020 / Tickets: $25 / Ages: 21+ / Doors: 6pm / Show: 8pm /  / Musician. Producer. Beatsmith. Recording artist. Composer. Dance-floor general. Label-head. A mystery man of many hats, The Polish Ambassador rocks more than just a trademark jumpsuit, authoring sublime, intentional artistic works, animated safaris in technicolor sound. At first breath, The Polish Ambassador was an experiment, David Sugalski’s sound-art passion project that came to life. An inventive, imaginary character born of humble, humorous beginnings, he found his first audiences through the support of primitive digital radio stations. Today, TPA is among the premier EDM/live crossover artists in the country with millions of listeners around the world; he’s consistently in-demand at the live music-focused gatherings and boutique electronic festivals from coast to coast. Founder of independent label Jumpsuit Records, an environmentalist and early progenitor of the permaculture action movement, the world’s funkiest diplomat is here to party with a purpose. /  / Since 2006, The Polish Ambassador has consistently released critically-acclaimed full-length albums on Jumpsuit Records, alongside a dizzying number of side-projects and multi-form collaborations. All the while launching the careers of a diverse smattering of artists that run the gamut in geography and genre. TPA continues to spread his wings in teaming up with eclectic musicians from around the world, including Matisyahu, Nitty Scott, Zion I, The Grouch, Mr. Lif, and dozens of others. He is one-half of the celebrated folktronica project Wildlight, a duo in which he pairs with ethereal songstress Ayla Nereo. /  / The Polish Ambassador’s prolific output incorporates many styles, from exuberant global-house to fatback mid-tempo funk, you’ll pick up on West African percussion alongside stirring Kirtan melodies, a psychedelic sax solo or a fresh verse from a Brooklyn female emcee. TPA employs live horns, keyboards, guitars, violins, and a bevy of talented instrumentalists on stage. “The Jumpsuited One” has headlined iconic venues like Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, and the renowned counter-culture gathering Oregon Country Fair. Suwannee Hulaween, Electric Forest, Envision Festival, and Lightning in a Bottle and other national festivals have each repeatedly invited TPA back across different years. /  / In alignment with TPA’s artistic ethos is a low-key lifestyle that places a premium on being present, living in harmony with nature, participating in community and inspiring it to thrive. Offstage, David Sugalski instigated a village-building convergence in his hometown in Northern California, and manages his own 25-acre homestead in the picture-Esque, rolling Sierra Nevada foothills. The farmer/carpenter lives modestly in a cabin he built on his land of the lush; TPA music is created in a solar-powered recording studio on the property. When he removes the famed bright blue-and-yellow 80’s jumpsuit and reverts back to his humanoid self, Sugalski is an avid solo bicyclist who enjoys venturing up California’s breathtaking coastal Highway 1; he’s a dedicated van-adventurer, having built out an exquisite tiny home inside a contractors van. /  / Sugalski plans his TPA tours for minimum carbon footprint, he advocates for healthy-beverage alternatives at music venues. Jumpsuit Records has donated tens of thousands of dollars to various non-profit organizations and charities; a portion of the label split goes to supporting non-profits voted on by fans. TPA’s awareness-in-action coalesces with numerous non-profit endeavors, including Jumpsuit Records, own 501(c) certified organization ActionDays.us. TPA decided to eliminate the merchandise from his business model, in order to facilitate a fan-operated buy-and-sell marketplace. The Polish Ambassador has evolved exponentially, from an art project to a vibration; a joyful community that thrives on the dance floor and finds freedom, connection, and collective oneness through this music. /  / Sale Dates and Times: /  / Public Onsale : Mon, 24 Feb 2020 at 01:00 PM","The Polish Ambassador, Nitty Scott, saQi ",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1396628,.

With the precise and dynamic Swiss rhythm section of Marino Pliakas (electric bass) and Michael Wertmüller (drums), the group is referred to by Brotzmann himself as simply “THE TRIO.” Full Blast frequently conjures the essence of Brötzmann's landmark early free recording Machine Gun in its visceral intensity, while also, in the words of Tim Niland, being “far more than Peter Brötzmann with a rhythm section, [but] a fully functioning band that is a group of equals that play together as comrades.” /  / John Wiese presents the U.S. premiere of a new 8 channel composition commissioned by Ina/GRM. Known for his individual approach at the intersection of American noise and modern composition, Wiese’s artistic practice crosses many disciplines, but often shares conceptual similarities to musique concrète and is expressed through fixed recorded works, diffusions, performance, and installations. In 2016, Wiese was invited to perform at the Ina/GRM’s Présences Électronique Festival along with a residency at their multi-channel studio in the basement of Radio France. /  / ISSUE is also pleased to present Victoria Shen performing new solo work, following her collaborative performance of “Laminals II” last year with 2019 Artist-In-Residence Charmaine Lee. Shen’s music floods its location acting as a form of sculpture. Her music features analog modular synthesizers (Flower Electronics), contact microphones, and other self-built electronics. These instruments are designed to electronically create chaotic systems, systems which are highly sensitive to small changes in their initial parameters. The resulting music eschews conventions in harmony and rhythm in favor of the extreme textures and gestural tones. /  / An aggressive, emotive free jazz trio, Full Blast is another project of reedman Peter Brötzmann's touring and recording configurations and includes the explosive rhythm section of Marino Pliakas on electric bass and Michael Wertmüller on drums. Wertmüller and Brötzmann toured with each other for years as a duo, and Wertmüller and Pliakas worked with each other frequently on various festival gigs, as well. The trio issued a debut album, the self-titled Full Blast, in 2006 on the German Jazzwerkstatt imprint, following it with Black Hole on Atavistic in 2009. Recently, they have released a series of records on TROST, including Sketches and Ballads (2011) also featuring Ken Vandermark and Dirk Rothbrus, Risc (2016), and Rio (2018). The group has toured consistently since fall of 2004, visiting the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Chile, Japan, China, UK, Ireland, Germany, Norway, Finland, Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Slovenia, Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Italy, France, Spain, Serbia, Ukraine, Switzerland, Egypt, Israel, and Russia. They have also performed and many international contemporary jazz and new music festivals, concert halls, clubs, and venues worldwide. /  / John Wiese is an artist and composer living and working in Los Angeles and Cleveland. From his experiments with recording as a teenager, he has since gone on to work in the world of contemporary sound art and the international experimental community. His sounds can be completely serene and sublime while at the same time being as equally frenetic and irregular, a sign of the artist’s ability to adapt and utilize a wide palette to build captivating aural works. As a performer and recording artist, his expertise in composition, texture, and experimentation with sound confirm his reputation of being an original and innovative voice in experimental music. /  / Victoria Shen is a musician, visual artist, and instrument maker native to San Francisco and working out of New England. Shen's sound practice is concerned with the spatiality/physicality of sound and its relationship to the human body. Shen's multidisciplinary visual work operates within the space where science, technology, craft, and art history overlap. Shen has performed solo across North America, Japan, Mexico, and Europe as Victoria Shen and Evicshen and as half of the duo TRIM in North America and the UK. Some notable venues in which she has performed include Boston City Hall, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, ISSUE Project Room NY, DOMMUNE Tokyo, and Petreon Sculpture Park Cyprus. Shen has also been an artist in residence at Elektronmusikstudion EMS Stockholm SE, WORM Rotterdam NL, Kurimanzutto New York US, and the Sound Laboratory of The Royal Danish Academy Copenhagen DK.","Full Blast (Peter Brötzmann / Marino Pliakas / Michael Wertmüller), John Wiese, Victoria Shen",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1403860,First Unitarian Congreg,new york,Sage Hill,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115194724/sage-hill,34.5392,-119.7911,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60763-Activities-New_York_City_New_York.html,'40.69500685', '-73.9929862'

1876,Kali Malone / Puce Mary / Tongue Depressor,6/20/2020,"Saturday, June 20th, ISSUE presents an expansive program at the Flamboyán Theater at The Clemente in the Lower East Side featuring American composer and musician Kali Malone, the ISSUE return of Puce Mary (Frederikke Hoffmeier) performing solo work, as well as Tongue Depressor, the New Haven-based duo project of multi-instrumentalists Zach Rowden and Henry Birdsey. /  / Kali Malone performs music from her as-yet unannounced upcoming record, which is a series of pieces in septimal just intonation for electronics, cello, and double bass. The pieces are a combination of canons and textural masses that utilize rational harmony to achieve dense yet calculated beatings in the critical band area. The record features Zach Rowden (contrabass) and Lucy Railton (cello) as the recorded musicians. Malone is known for using analog and digital synthesis within compositional frameworks that utilize unique tunings and psycho-acoustic phenomena. A recent string of albums explore this interplay within electroacoustic instrumentation: woodwinds with Buchla 200 synthesiser, strings quartets with sine waves, and – most notably – the pipe organ close mic’d and spatialized. These methods culminated in the major work The Sacrificial Code, which was Boomkat's album of the year for 2019. In the live context, Malone plays both organ-based and purely electronic shows. /  / Puce Mary returns to ISSUE for the first time since her appearance during 2014’s Swedish Energies festival. In 2018, Hoffmeier released a standout LP The Drought on PAN. Building from a reputation of arresting live performances and critically acclaimed releases, Hoffmeier broke new ground with The Drought, evolving the tropes of industrial and power electronics to forge an expanded vocabulary where space, harmony, and lyricism surface into a complex sonic and literary narrative. Her working methods have often been diverse, with a sound incorporating everything from concrete sound-poetry, first person narrative, and deliberate collages of field recordings and sound sources into ominous drone and dense feedback. /  / Tongue Depressor, the experimental instrumental duo of Zach Rowden and Henry Birdsey, work with various instrumental arrangements, but most often with fiddles. Inviting a vague narrative around Appalachian Pentecostalism, the duo has released five volumes of ecstatic, trance-inducing fiddle music, with pieces dedicated to figures such as the late snake-handling pastor Jamie Coots, French pharmacist Joseph Bienaimé Caventou, and other obscure Appalachian names such as Darlene Summerford, Maudie Lankford, and more. At ISSUE, the duo performs their singular fiddle duo alongside orchestra bells and aluminum nesting dolls. /  / Headquartered in Stockholm, Kali Malone is an American composer and musician who creates sonic monoliths that tug at the very material of listening. Employing acoustic and synthetic instrumentation in repetitive and extended durations, Malone’s rich harmonic textures emit a distinct emotive hue serving to generate a captivating and uncanny depth of focus. Malone has performed extensively throughout Europe and North America, with notable features at Berlin Atonal, Moogfest, Cafe Oto, Le Guess Who?, and Ina GRM. She has collaborated and performed with a variety of artists including Caterina Barbieri, Ellen Arkbro, Sorrowing Christ, Puce Mary, Free The Land, Zach Rowden, Leila Bordreuil and Lucy Railton. In 2016 she co-founded the record label XKatedral together with Maria W Horn. She holds both a BFA and MFA in electro-acoustic composition from the Royal College of Music in Stockholm. /  / Puce Mary is the solo moniker of Danish born experimental artist, Frederikke Hoffmeier. Since her first LP released in 2013, the project has explored the fields of industrial noise and experimental music with a vast number of releases on labels such as PAN, Posh Isolation, iDEAL Recordings, and Ascetic House. Often identified with the now-generation of power electronics, Puce Mary has a reputation for intense live-performances that span from gripping renditions of fresh material to the the full-on fury of off-the-cuff harsh noise. Her working methods are diverse, with a sound that is constantly evolving through her latest live sets and releases, to recent collaborative work with Francesco Leali, Heith, and Alessandro Branca. /  / Tongue Depressor (New Haven, CT) is the duo of Henry Birdsey (fiddle, lap steel) and Zach Rowden (fiddle, upright bass, microtonal organ). They write, improvise, and perform music that draws from the fields of drone, harsh noise, and church music, often using microtonal tunings. Recent projects and releases include the the ongoing Fiddle Music series (currently 5 volumes), Dregs (December 2019/ Thalamos), Broad Is The Road That Leads To Death (2018 C/Site Recordings), and To See Not, a trio recording with percussionist Trevor Saint (Glockenspiel) released via Obsolete Staircases (Kentucky). /  / Henry Birdsey is a multi-instrumentalist, composer, and recording engineer from Vermont, working primarily with pedal steel + lap steel, microtonal organ, violin, and homemade instruments. His music is often drone-based and involves microtonal tunings, the amplification of metal, and fragments of church music. /  / Zach Rowden is a American multi-instrumentalist that deals with the in-between of music and perception.

1892,Kraftwerk 50th Anniversary 3-D Tour,7/18/2020,"After their worldwide hugely successful 3-D concert tours, the Electro pioneers Kraftwerk announce North American tour dates for summer 2020. Bringing together music, 3-D visuals and performance art, KRAFTWERK are a true „Gesamtkunstwerk„ a total work of art. /  / The multi-media project Kraftwerk was started in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. They set up their electronic Kling Klang Studio in Düsseldorf, Germany where they conceived and produced all Kraftwerk albums. By the mid-1970’s Kraftwerk had achieved international recognition for their revolutionary electronic‚ soundscapes and their musical experimentation with robotics and other technical innovations. With their visions of the future, Kraftwerk created the soundtrack for the digital age of the 21st century. Their compositions, using / innovative techniques, synthetic voices and computerized rhythms, have had a major / international influence across an entire range of music genres: from Electro to Hip Hop, from Techno to SynthPop. /  / In their live performances, Kraftwerk–Ralf Hütter, Henning Schmitz, Fritz Hilpert, Falk / Grieffenhagen–illustrate their belief in the respective contributions of both man and machine. Starting with the retrospective of their catalogue at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2012, in recent years Kraftwerk have returned full circle back to their origins within the Düsseldorf art scene of the late Sixties. The 3-D concert series at MoMA was followed by further presentations at Tate Modern Turbine Hall (London), Akasaka Blitz (Tokyo) Opera House (Sydney), Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles), Fondation Louis Vuitton (Paris), Neue National Galerie (Berlin) and Guggenheim Museum (Bilbao).

He quickly established a reputation as an eclectic and adaptive DJ, utilizing years of music making and performance experience to develop a finely tuned sensitivity to quality selection and reading a room.

He has also produced an extensive catalog of 12”s and LP’s, mostly for the record label established by his old friend James Murphy, DFA Records, including the seminal dance floor hit ‘Happy House,’ first released in 2009. In 2010 Juan was recruited to contribute a mix for the legendary DJ Kick’s series, helping to spread House music to a wider audience on the cusp of the resurgence of House as a world wide phenomenon.

After a weekly internet radio show led to some bookings, Mrs Magoo found herself increasingly drawn to the sounds of jungle and dnb and by 2013 she was a certified junglist. That year saw her playing her first headline set at Jungle Nation in Aberdeen, one of Scotland’s longest running jungle nights. /  / Joining Deep in the Jungle Records and residencies at Jungle Splash London, Unity Edinburgh and Better Breakbeat Bureau USA have helped her carve out a name for herself.

2033,Sunday Revival // JKriv & Peter Croce,2/23/2020,"Rocksteady Disco returns to MotorCity Wine for a very special SUNDAY REVIVAL with special guest JKriv. This event continues a monthly residency at MotorCity Wine with the Rocksteady Disco friendship circle. /  / JKriv is a Brooklyn-based producer, DJ, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and label-owner. With a professional musical career stretching nearly 2 decades, J has gained serious attention recently for his masterfully crafted disco reworks, original productions, and rousing DJ sets. A Traxsource Top-20 Nu Disco / Indie Dance artist for the past 2 years, his tracks have been played by DJs such as Derrick Carter, Disclosure, Andrew Weatherall, Louie Vega, Kenny Dope, Mark Farina, Greg Wilson, and have gained mainstream support from Drake and Majid Jordan in their Apple Music OVO Radio show, as well as legendary BBC Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong and BB6’s Craig Charles. /  / Bringing a seasoned musicality to everything he touches, JKriv’s talent for organic production and songwriting is evident in his original songs Another Night, Make It Hot and Redo, as well as his recent disco opus Vertigo, released October 2018 on Joey Negro’s Z Records. A sprawling production with dazzling live instrumentation performed primarily by J himself, Vertigo shows J’s knack for seamlessly melding modern and retro club sounds. /  / With releases on Disco Deviance, Barefoot Beats, Secret Squirrels, Whiskey Disco and his own Razor-N-Tape among others, J has solidified his status as a master of the modern edit/rework, and has been called on to remix numerous artists such as Dimitri from Paris, Imagination, Escort and more. Luke Solomon recently tapped J to remix his anthemic Powerdance tune A Safe and Happy Place. J’s remix, another disco belter which set late-summer Ibiza dance floors alight, is set to drop October 2018 on Classic Music. A purveyor and curator of outer-national sounds as well, JKriv dropped Ferias ’77, an album of varied Brazilian reworks on Razor-N-Tape or RSD 2018, and also has remixed for Soundway Records and Africa Seven. /  / Like his productions, JKriv’s DJ sets showcase his deep and diverse taste, weaving eclectic disco, house, and offbeat selections together seamlessly, always with an ear for groove and harmony, and an eye to the dance floor. In addition to regular nights at hometown hotspots Black Flamingo, Le Bain, Good Room, Output and Elsewhere, J has performed and DJ’d in over 30 countries and nearly every state in the continental US, sharing bills with Todd Terje, Session Victim, Joey Negro, and many more. JKriv is also a foundational member of the live disco band Escort, co-writing, producing, and touring with the group at Coachella, Sasquatch Festival and innumerable club gigs around the world. JKriv has been announced on the lineup for the boutique Mareh Music festival in Brazil for NYE 2019. /  / JKriv’s talents as a tastemaker extend beyond the studio and DJ booth, as co-owner of respected Brooklyn record label Razor-N-Tape. RNT now boasts a 50 release-deep catalog that has garnered support and spins from some of the biggest names in modern dance music, and is one of the most respected and consistent new disco labels in the game today. /  / He'll be joined by Peter Croce. The 2 will be playing 5 hours of unexpected and danceable deep house, jazz, funk, balearic, disco, techno, and other spirit music. /  / More information below... /  / +++ JKriv: https://soundcloud.com/jkriv /  / +++ Peter Croce: https://soundcloud.com/petercroce /  / No cover / 21+ / artwork by Gino / food by NOODL","JKriv, Peter Croce",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1385090,MotorCity Wine,detroit,Aquatic Park Cove San Francisco Maritime Nhp,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115210663/aquatic-park-cove-san-francisco-maritime-nhp,37.8067,-122.4239,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g42139-Activities-Detroit_Michigan.html,'42.3311588', '-83.0730347247209'

2081,Sunday Revival // Dean Dixon & Peter Croce,3/23/2020,"Rocksteady Disco returns to MotorCity Wine for a very special SUNDAY REVIVAL with special guest Dean Dixon. This event continues a monthly residency at MotorCity Wine with the Rocksteady Disco friendship circle. /  / Dean Dixon believes there’s great music in every genre, you simply require the passion, dedication and patience to lay your fingers on it. It’s for that reason his DJ style espouses diversity. Dean takes listeners on unexpected journeys through a diverse array of soundscapes anytime he’s manning the helm.  /  / Previously on the Australian underground music scene, Dean started and ran HAHA Industries and played regularly alongside Dave Fernandes (House of Mince/Aus) for over a decade. As D&D, they warmed the floors alongside some of the world’s most prominent international electronic music makers and forged a musical pathway down the side streets, forgotten laneways and dark warehouse spaces that made up the more unique aspects of the Sydney late night party scene. /  / Dean relocated to Bali in 2017 to take on a DJ residency at Indonesia’s highly lauded Potato Head Beach Club. He quickly also took on residencies at several other key establishments on the island, including Rock Bar, The W Hotel, Karma Beach Bali, and many others. Dean’s skills have landed him at gigs further afield in China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Australia and his native Canada. He’s supported everyone from heavyweights like Robert Hood, Juan Atkins and Kenny Larkin to eclectic diggers like Optimo and Tim Sweeney to the bastion of Balearic sound, Jon Sa Trinxa. Dean has more recently decided to start 2020 off in his original homeland, Canada and presently hosts his monthly radio show, “Inner Circles” from the CTRL room studios in Toronto between his guest spots. /  / His endless pursuit to find weird and wonderful sounds and share them with others creates special moments each and every time he plays, whether that’s at a 4000-person venue warming up the dance floor for a Platinum award-winning or Grammy nominated international act on New Year’s Eve or serving up more intimate Balearic sounds at a beach club during sunset. /  / He'll be joined by Peter Croce. The 2 will be playing 5 hours of unexpected and danceable deep house, jazz, funk, balearic, disco, techno, and other spirit music. /  / More information below... /  / +++ Dean Dixon: https://soundcloud.com/ddfriendsnotfoes /  / +++ Peter Croce: https://soundcloud.com/petercroce /  / No cover / 21+ / artwork by Gino / food by NOODL","Dean Dixon, Peter Croce",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1400356,MotorCity Wine,detroit,Kirby Cove Campground,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115195250/kirby-cove-campground,37.8403,-122.4889,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g42139-Activities-Detroit_Michigan.html,'42.3311588', '-83.0730347247209'

Bringing together music, 3-D visuals and performance art, KRAFTWERK are a true „Gesamtkunstwerk„ a total work of art. /  / The multi-media project Kraftwerk was started in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. They set up their electronic Kling Klang Studio in Düsseldorf, Germany where they conceived and produced all Kraftwerk albums. By the mid-1970’s Kraftwerk had achieved international recognition for their revolutionary electronic‚ soundscapes and their musical experimentation with robotics and other technical innovations. With their visions of the future, Kraftwerk created the soundtrack for the digital age of the 21st century. Their compositions, using / innovative techniques, synthetic voices and computerized rhythms, have had a major / international influence across an entire range of music genres: from Electro to Hip Hop, from Techno to SynthPop. /  / In their live performances, Kraftwerk–Ralf Hütter, Henning Schmitz, Fritz Hilpert, Falk / Grieffenhagen–illustrate their belief in the respective contributions of both man and machine. Starting with the retrospective of their catalogue at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2012, in recent years Kraftwerk have returned full circle back to their origins within the Düsseldorf art scene of the late Sixties. The 3-D concert series at MoMA was followed by further presentations at Tate Modern Turbine Hall (London), Akasaka Blitz (Tokyo) Opera House (Sydney), Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles), Fondation Louis Vuitton (Paris), Neue National Galerie (Berlin) and Guggenheim Museum (Bilbao). In 2014 Ralf Hütter and his former partner were honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.",Kraftwerk,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1394965,Masonic Temple,detroit,Eugene O'neill National Historic Site,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115208078/eugene-oneill-national-historic-site,37.8265,-122.0267,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g42139-Activities-Detroit_Michigan.html,'42.341363', '-83.060217'

Today, many artists who have been Rich's idols have become peers, and his fans often become his friends, even if just through the shared experience of music. Countless couples and relationships were commenced to the soundtracks he has created time and time again. His eloquence extends well beyond the music he plays—Medina's spontaneous use of language speaks to the fact that he's been a well-respected spoken word artist for over a quarter century, not to mention that he's a journalist who has contributed columns and features to a wide variety of publications, including The Fader, Complex and Wax Poetics. Rich is a card-carrying member of the Rock Steady Crew and the Universal Zulu Nation. And he has consistently lent his name to charitable organizations close to his heart, most recently The Africa Center, Room to Grow and GrassRoots. /  / While Medina could rest on all of his past accomplishments, he has retained the energy of a prizefighter, constantly seeking something greater as both an artist and a businessman, steadily building a respected brand with his own two hands. Rich is one of those rare people who has built himself a platform on his own terms, in his own way, achieving success with every step he takes and enriching countless souls with incredible music and unique wisdom.",Rich Medina,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1366891,Resident,los angeles,Bicentennial Campground,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115210559/bicentennial-campground,37.8309,-122.5247,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g32655-Activities-Los_Angeles_California.html,'34.04272815', '-118.234942180885'

He is Worthy. With an in-depth knowledge of production, mixing & performance, Worthy has the insight to play for his audience, cultivating intense positive energy on the dancefloor. From salty aired islands to dark club basements, over the past 12 years, Worthy has paid reverence to the traditional form of classic house while tripping off the mark & sinking into the euphoric less-charted territories of booty-clapping bass. As Carl Cox said, “The Worthy sound has always been powerful, rocking, funky, bass-driven music at its best & for me this is the new wave in house music.” He establishes an energetic dance floor camaraderie that makes even the most skeptic hater’s booty shake. /  / BOT (DIRTYBIRD : FOOD MUSIC : PSYCHO DISCO) / https://soundcloud.com/bot106 / Bot is of the future. Half man, half-machine; fully Italian. Exiled in West London, locked in the studio since departing legendary duo Crookers, Bot (his creators named him Andrea Fratangelo) has disassembled any expectations and rebuilt his sound for 2018.  /  / Since forging his new solo path, Bot has prepared half a dozen releases to deliver throughout 2013. The first, ""Vamos / Go Down"" EP was hastily snatched by Steve Aoki's Dim Mak label and released in March. His 2nd release, 'Indastria 2028' followed in May on his own label Main Course (with partners Astronomar & Neoteric). Next up are 2 smashers for Blood Music (Trails/One Hour) which will see the light in July and have since debuted in Fake Blood's Fabric Live 69 compilation. To round out the year, Bot joins the crew at Southern Fried once again, to drop the ""Friday Pulse"" EP and remixes, featuring the legendary Robert Owens. On top of that, more music from Bot and friends is being prepared for Main Course, and he's stayed busy remixing the likes of Diplo & Wiley.

2285,Traffic 2020 with Urulu and Manu Miran,1/25/2020,"PERFECT VISION /  / Traffic LA, now in our second year of Rave Queer, we strive to bring the Los Angeles queer nightlife scene something unique and exciting to it's party goers. We are very happy to announce that we are continuing with our curve ball bookings by bringing you one of LA's best kept secrets, the truly masterful producer and deep digging selector Urulu (Liquid Earth) and the hardest working force and creator in Boston Underground Manu Miran (Visceral). Join us for a ride. /  / Urulu  /  / The singular brand of house music that Taylor Freels produces as Urulu is uniquely transatlantic, infusing the rhythmic sensibilities of London and Berlin with the sun-soaked serenity of his native California. Described by RA as having an “impressively complete grasp of what makes a classic house cut”, this talented producer has dropped acclaimed releases on respected imprints such as NYC's Let's Play House and Melbourne’s Voyage Recordings, as well as taste-making outlets such as Needwant, Shabby Doll and Spanish outfit Saft/Pulp. In addition to his considerable abilities as a creator of high-voltage dance music, Freels is also an inspired selector, armed with the chutzpah to mix ruff-n-ready Detroit and Chicago emanations with modern, future-facing house sounds. /  / With evocative, retro-futuristic productions that showcase a stripped back, classic feel, Urulu's sounds are a throwback to the lost generation of classic groove-makers. The Los Angeles-based producer has a well-honed knack for finding a track's sweet spot. His dynamic arrangements instantly piqued the interest of peers, critics and fans alike following his releases on Let’s Play House, Saft and Voyage Recordings, in addition to well-received releases on his own imprint Amadeus Records, Urulu has made a name for himself as a visionary producer specialising in euphoric nostalgia, working with an extensive sonic toolkit that includes emotive vocal samples, weighty percussion, luscious chords and low-slung basslines. / 2018 has seen two of Urulu’s finest releases yet: the ‘Banshee EP’ on venerable Spanish imprint Saft, and the distinctly psychedelic ‘Foreign Depths’ for hotly-tipped Dutch label Kalahari Oyster Cult. With a tightly-packed DJ schedule and more unabashedly ecstatic house wizardry in the works, Urulu’s meteoric career is set to continue rising. https://soundcloud.com/urulu /  / Manu Miran /  / Venezuelan-born curator, founder and resident DJ of Boston-based multidisciplinary platform, Visceral. Manu's vocation with establishing Visceral in 2016, stemmed from the shortage of marginalized POC & LGBTQ+ talent within his community. Manu and Visceral's mission to promote diversity & cultural inclusivity, in addition to merging music with visual arts, has been essential to the growth of the POC and Queer scene in Boston. Miran's music genre draws from a broad range of undercurrent sensuality rooted from the boldest, rawest sounds of Berlin, Detroit, and Latin America. https://soundcloud.com/manumiran /  / Residents: / Mike ETC  / ThoughtKnot (David OH) /  / And as Always /  / NO RACISM / NO MISOGYNY / NO TRANSPHOBIA / NO HOMOPHOBIA / NO ASSHOLES / NO GODS / NO MASTERS /  / RAVE QUEER","Urulu, Manu Miran, Mike ETC, ThoughtKnot",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1370736,TBA - Los Angeles,los angeles,Bicentennial Campground,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115210559/bicentennial-campground,37.8309,-122.5247,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g32655-Activities-Los_Angeles_California.html,,

2316,Into The Woods with Fred P aka Black Jazz Consortium,1/31/2020,"21+ / Meyer Sound / TBA venue /  / Fred P aka Black Jazz Consortium / -> soundcloud.com/black-jazz-consortium /  / “Deep”, perhaps the word most associated with the career of Fred P, and for once, an accurate portrayal. Eleven albums, innumerable releases and decades of Djing into his career, the New York-turned-Berlin resident continues to push further into his own sound, craft, and mind. For those fortunate enough to be present for one of Fred's cathartic, physical and spiritual DJ sets, the dancefloor is not just a place for enjoyment, but for potential. /  / That opportunity for potential – his own, yours, that of our collective consciousness – has long-been the earnest pursuit of Fred P, channeled expertly through his evolved and deeply personal exploration of house and techno music. His futurist approach is inspired as much by the scene's bonafide revolutionaries, Frankie Knuckles to David Morales and Danny Tenaglia, as his own futurist philosophy, weaved together from a glorious patchwork inspired by an ever-expanding network or thinkers, collaborators, and international encounters. /  / If this all sounds rather academic, then any appearance from Fred P will cement the sound of his vision. Years dancing at New York nightspots such as Red Zone, Sound Factory and Tunnel proved to be the sort of open-minded education that cannot be bought, cannot be sold and cannot be hyped. Here, among an eclectic cast throng of consciously aligned fellow party-goers, Fred P learned pleasure and patience from extensive record collections that often went some way to suggest that less can mean more. /  / It's a confidence that runs through his music and Djing, and most recently earned him a quarterly residency split between London's twin clubs, Oval Space and Pickle Factory, sharing the bill with like-minded contemporaries. He was also handed control of the club's sound system for several all-night sessions, a favorite format of his, creating space to conjure a unique, sensual and almost psychedelic early morning atmosphere that the New York native is almost notorious for being able to conjure like few others (refer to his own cult classic, '6AM' for a seductive glimpse of this particular sound.) /  / All this in mind, what's the eventual aim? /  / “Like-minds together, to raise each other's consciousness”, he considers. “And with that, you can have an experience. I'm all for that because I know music can be medicine. Meditation... It's a gift for everybody. So to use it with intent but not self-interest – which is very difficult nowadays – it's all about the time you're given and the quality of what you decide to do with that time.” /  / Time passes, for better or worse, and with that, change must be embraced. 2018 sees Fred P bring his acclaimed Soul People Music outlet to an end and embrace a new label, Perpetual Sound. Launching with a new recording for arguably his best-loved alias, Black Jazz Consortium, the label will be guided solely by his proven eye for emotion and evolution, anticipating new collaborations and styles. /  / That first release was a statement, tellingly titled ‘Evolutions’, adorned with a retro-futurist cover that harks back, perhaps with a sigh, to retro-sixties futurism. On the cusp of an AI revolution, in the midst of political, cultural and social tension and disruption on an international scale, Fred P is determined to ensure optimism and futurism lead forward his practice. /  / “The 20th century was big on originality... The 21st century, so far, not too much”, he reflects. “That attitude in general, towards everything, pushes this singular ethos. The us or nothing bullshit. So what's standing in the way of the obvious stuff? What is the end goal? The end goal is to fully embrace our potential and to remove the things that hold us back: Greed, envy, and self-interest. To embrace a more humanitarian approach Not just for ourselves, but for our species.”","Fred P, Jimmy Maheras",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1372015,TBA - Los Angeles,los angeles,Granite Flat (California),https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115195629/granite-flat-california,39.2992,-120.2036,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g32655-Activities-Los_Angeles_California.html,,

The inclusion of the word ‘Corps’ is meant as a synonym for ‘unity or a body of people engaged in a particular activity.’ The inspiration behind Rocky Hill is Sassounian’s drive to bring both the sounds he was introduced to as a child, and the ones self-discovered from his bedroom, onto the dance floor: “Rocky Hill is my home; it’s where I grew up. It’s where I was introduced to my likes and dislikes, and where I feel the safest. That’s what I wish my colleagues and artists to feel.” Sassounian prefers to maintain a close knit and indie mindset when working with artists under his wing. /  / Arthur Kaplan and Gabe Lopez grew up in Miami together. They both studied Art and Design from an early age. Kaplan’s focus is Fabrication and Production Design, while Lopez’s focus is in Industrial Design. Both moved out to Los Angeles to pursue their careers a few years ago. Kaplan is the art director for Rocky Hill, while Lopez is a collaborative consultant. Darone Sassounian is born and raised in Los Angeles. He previously worked at Backside Records as a record buyer and Ubiquity Records as a label coordinator. He currently is the agent for artists such as, Bosq and Basil & Rogers. /  / The trio first met at a music venue in Los Angeles in 2016. Having similar tastes in music, the three began experimenting with sounds and started to play records they admired, all in the presence of good company. “The three of us are drawn towards many different sounds. When we play records together, there’s a natural cohesion of unique sounds that blend well with one another. It varies from afro boogie, disco, house, and techno. It’s all music with a soul; some rare and some not so rare.” /  / www.rockyhillrecords.us","Darone Sassounian, Arthur Kaplan and Gabe Lopez as Rocky Hill Corps",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1368107,Club Tee Gee,los angeles,Lands End Lookout,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115208083/lands-end-lookout,37.7797,-122.5115,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g32655-Activities-Los_Angeles_California.html,'34.1176619166667', '-118.260877791667'

He went on to recruit members influenced by disparate upbringings in the worlds of underground punk, no wave, experimental jazz, and classical music training. The project has since evolved into a blissfully painful wall of sound interweaving shoegaze, ambient, electro-industrial, sludge, and something akin to Sleep meets Stereolab. Draag gained a reputation for their sonically immersive live shows, transforming the most DIY to the most sophisticated of spaces into what was described as a dive into a Neptunian air chamber – a storm in slow motion. “Nontoxic Process,” a compilation of tracks released in 2018 with the first single “Sorry (Dispensa)” premiered by Noisey, was created in the midst of severe health complications, forcing the band to write in a visceral and honest form without pretension. Draag is set to release a new EP and full-length in the upcoming year.","Draag, Alms, Foliage, The Shaking Hands, Marina (The Witching Hours KXLU) DJ",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1380268,The Echo,los angeles,Bicentennial Campground,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115210559/bicentennial-campground,37.8309,-122.5247,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g32655-Activities-Los_Angeles_California.html,'34.0980789', '-118.3123144'

This is sacred dust, alchemical practice to convert anxiety into the highest form of creativity. It is rapping ass-rapping rapped better than your favorite rapper. /  / Let Sandman tell it: the sound is dusty. These bars are his id. He’s not trying to save the world on this record or even save himself. These are the unmasked impulses and desires locked away for a long time -- some of them from before he ditched the legal world for decapitating mediocre MCs. On Dusty, he says “ I unlocked myself and let them out -- dusted them off -- for better or for worse.” /  / Of course, it’s infinitely for the better.

2369,Cub Scout with Sharif Laffrey: 10 Year Anniversary,2/7/2020,"Celebrating 10 years of leather bar shenanigans with Sharif Laffrey... /  / A true lynchpin of the Detroit underground. Sharif has been DJing internationally for 20 years. Before producing music, Sharif's participation in Detroit's early rave scene during the early 1990s led him to organize loft parties & DJing. Loft party highlights include Jack White dancing in his underwear & Kraftwerk showing up unannounced. In his ever low key mode, Sharif has quietly kept the Detroit night scene alive in a time when just about all others had given up or moved out. Sharif has programmed the Underground Stage of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival (DEMF / Fuse-In Festival / Movement Festival) in 2003, 2004 and in 2005 curated the new TodaysMusic Stage showcasing artists ranging from Wolf Eyes, Tamion 12 Inch, the legendary ESG and Liquid Liquid to Thomas Fehlmann and Legowelt. Sharif is also an operative for Detroit's most elusive organization: Underground Resistance. In addition to all this, from April 2004 to June 2005, Sharif through his Soft Curls crew directed the program of the most critically acclaimed new venue in Detroit. Over this last year alone Soft Curls have curated a surprising abundance of legendary nights in various dark corners of Detroit, ranging from Alexander Robotnick's first appearance ever in the Motor City with surprise warm up DJ set by Carl Craig, a Prince afterparty with Moodyman playing all Prince records, Juan Atkins with Perspects of Le Car as the warm up DJ, Detroit's notorious annual Cannonball event with Electric Skin (BMG of Ectomorph and Sal Principato of Liquid Liquid)... the list goes on.","Sharif Laffrey (Special Forces Records, ESP Institute / NYC), Chris Bowen, Victor Rodriguez",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1379358,Eagle LA,los angeles,Golden Gate Bridge Welcome Center,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115208082/golden-gate-bridge-welcome-center,37.8078,-122.475,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g32655-Activities-Los_Angeles_California.html,'34.0911143221047', '-118.283748756745'

He went on to recruit members influenced by disparate upbringings in the worlds of underground punk, no wave, experimental jazz, and classical music training. The project has since evolved into a blissfully painful wall of sound interweaving shoegaze, ambient, electro-industrial, sludge, and something akin to Sleep meets Stereolab. Draag gained a reputation for their sonically immersive live shows, transforming the most DIY to the most sophisticated of spaces into what was described as a dive into a Neptunian air chamber – a storm in slow motion. “Nontoxic Process,” a compilation of tracks released in 2018 with the first single “Sorry (Dispensa)” premiered by Noisey, was created in the midst of severe health complications, forcing the band to write in a visceral and honest form without pretension.","Draag, Gold Cage, Orchin, Sprain, Bloome DJ",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1380271,The Echoplex,los angeles,Descanso Rd,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115205702/descanso-rd,32.8342,-116.7427,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g32655-Activities-Los_Angeles_California.html,'34.0768642727273', '-118.260951454545'

2409,David August presents The Life of Merisi,2/12/2020,"The first shafts of morning light creep over the hilltop terraces, illuminating the ancient commune of Palestrina - David August breathes new air. Born in Hamburg in 1990, August composes and performs multifaceted electronic music with hopeful tones and a human aesthetic. “Creating music - the act of creating in general - should be free from rationalization. In the best case, relying solely on subconsciousness communication,” says the classically trained multi-instrumentalist. Speaking with David, one immediately realizes the value that he places upon his well-earned artistic independence and steadfast sincerity. This hard-fought pursuit can be traced clearly through the producer’s recorded works; from a string of early dance singles and remixes (2010-2014), followed by his celebrated debut album, Times (2013), to a handful of genre-defying outings on Ninja Tune sub-label, Counter Records (2016), the Tonmeister graduate (2017) continues to uncloak hidden inner paths yet to be discovered. /  / It is precisely this sense of conviction that has lured August to Palestrina, a crumbling, lesser-known, rural town, resting high in the peaks of Monti Prenestini, a colossal mountain range, towering across central Italy. The birthplace of his mother, this highland outpost has, as of recent, casted rays of inspiration upon the young musician. “After 26 years, I suddenly feel the urgency to connect actively with my Mediterranean provenience and culture. Although always present in me, I rather kept it hidden, private and absent from my creative work. These roots have always evoked the stronger emotions within me.” /  / While his live-show takes various shapes and forms, free improvisation lives at the core of the artist’s fascination. Whether he performs solo for the Boiler Room (2014) or a Resident Advisor Live Session (2015), recruits trusted musicians as part of his Ensemble (2015-2016), DJ’s traditionally or explores collaboration with the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin (2016), liberating moments of immediate expression remain a constant. /  / After a year of self-examination and introspection, August has re-emerged with a vitalizing, advanced, personal language. His latest albums D’Angelo and DCXXXIX A.C are impassioned documents written in this language, suited to express the emotions he’d kept hidden until now. His new label, 99CHANTS, promotes his own works and that of unsung new talents (Louis Sterling) and appreciated figures (Ambienti Coassialli, Giulio Aldinucci, Rafael Anton Irisarri, Ron Trent) who share this language, free of the constraints of a set genre or mood.

Frankie was raised in home filled with music, his grandfather was a musician in Puerto Rico and his father regularly plays and sings in bands in New York. As an adolescent, Frankie was exposed to and enthralled by the vibrant hip-hop culture that was exploding all over New York City, and he soon convinced his parents to buy him some DJ gear. Here then, was the genesis of Frankie’s DJ career…a fourteen year old, cutting, scratching and mimicking what he heard at block parties and on underground hip-hop radio shows. /  / A couple of years later, Frankie was introduced to house music through his older cousins who were regulars at the famed Paradise Garage. His first clubgoing experience was at Hearthrobs’s, with the resident being a then relatively unknown ‘Little Louie’ Vega. As Frankie continued to develop as a DJ and a producer, he also was inspired by house giants such as Shep Pettibone, Tony Humphries and Timmy Regisford. /  / After a brief stint working in promotions at Strictly Rhythm Records in 1990, he moved into DJ’ing and producing full time, with his first serious paid gig at none other than the famous Ministry Of Sound in London. He has since gone on to play at renowned parties all over the world, from Angels Of Love in Italy, to Dance Ritual and Shelter in NYC. /  / Frankie is a superb DJ, with brilliant programming and technical skills. He is also an amazing producer whose productions have garnered him acclaim for years. He’s produced such gems as “Don’t Ever Give Up” ,“Missing You” and achingly beautiful remixes of anthems such as “Ain’t No Running Away” (Paula Ralph), “Father” (Kenny Bobien) numerous others on Masters At Work, and King Street Records. Now with his own record company, Ricanstruction Label, Frankie is swiftly advancing on his musical journey, crossing borders and reaching new heights.","Frankie Feliciano, Mark Di Meo, Jerry Flores, Jacob Rodriguez, Darwin Flores",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1384239,The Little Easy,los angeles,Descanso Rd,https://www.rei.com/campgrounds/camp/115205702/descanso-rd,32.8342,-116.7427,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g32655-Activities-Los_Angeles_California.html,'34.0478753214286', '-118.250222619048'

Emerging in the fall of 2013 in a garage full of broken, sentimental equipment, Draag began as a solo project of Adrian Acosta, trained as a mariachi singer by his father who was an established norteño musician. He went on to recruit members influenced by disparate upbringings in the worlds of underground punk, no wave, experimental jazz, and classical music training. The project has since evolved into a blissfully painful wall of sound interweaving shoegaze, ambient, electro-industrial, sludge, and something akin to Sleep meets Stereolab. Draag gained a reputation for their sonically immersive live shows, transforming the most DIY to the most sophisticated of spaces into what was described as a dive into a Neptunian air chamber – a storm in slow motion. “Nontoxic Process,” a compilation of tracks released in 2018 with the first single “Sorry (Dispensa)” premiered by Noisey, was created in the midst of severe health complications, forcing the band to write in a visceral and honest form without pretension.","Draag, Dustin Wong & Brin, Night Dreamer, Soft Blue Shimmer, Asa Nakagawa DJ",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1380272,The Echoplex,los angeles,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g32655-Activities-Los_Angeles_California.html,'34.0768642727273', '-118.260951454545'

This proved to be an important step in Henri's evolution as an electronic music producer, as he is now highly regarded as a sound engineer by all his industry contemporaries. His mastering prowess is sought after by some of the most widely respected producers and labels. Christian Smith, Guy J, Hernan Cattaneo, Pig & Dan, Hope Recordings, Lost & Found, microCastle, Octopus Recordings, Sudbeat, Transmit Recordings and Tronic are just a small selection of the many artists and labels that swear by Henri's mastering expertise. /  / Cid Inc has always featured a wide array of electronic music talents in his DJ sets. The Swedish producer is on a never ending search for the freshest sounds and most promising up and coming talent. This passion ultimately led to the creation of the Replug Records imprint in 2009.

Since its inception Replug has showcased cutting edge sounds from both up and coming and renowned artists such as Hernan Cattaneo & Soundexile, Khen, Nick Muir, Dmitry Molosh, Andre Sabota, Darin Epsilon, Simos Tagias, Chicola, Barry Jamieson, Navar, Jamie Ste-vens, Marcelo Vasami, Deepfunk, Kassey Voorn, Luis Junior and several other highly respected producers and artists.” /  / *21+ / Private Event / Location TBA /  / * Event details will be emailed before the beginning of the event. / * You are required to opt-in to our e-mail list in order to get updates regarding event details.

He went on to recruit members influenced by disparate upbringings in the worlds of underground punk, no wave, experimental jazz, and classical music training. The project has since evolved into a blissfully painful wall of sound interweaving shoegaze, ambient, electro-industrial, sludge, and something akin to Sleep meets Stereolab. Draag gained a reputation for their sonically immersive live shows, transforming the most DIY to the most sophisticated of spaces into what was described as a dive into a Neptunian air chamber – a storm in slow motion. “Nontoxic Process,” a compilation of tracks released in 2018 with the first single “Sorry (Dispensa)” premiered by Noisey, was created in the midst of severe health complications, forcing the band to write in a visceral and honest form without pretension.","Draag, Shaki Tavi, Sam Wilkes, Alaska Reid, Reptilianaire DJ",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1380273,The Echo,los angeles,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g32655-Activities-Los_Angeles_California.html,'34.0980789', '-118.3123144'

2545,MDA Wednesdays with Kill Fenzy (Dirtybird),2/26/2020,"ABOUT KILL FRENZY: /  / Belgian born and Berlin based producer Seba, better known as Kill Frenzy, has an affinity for crude, lewd, deep and dark vibrations. As a teenager, he acquired a distinct taste for house and techno from the greats: Jeff Mills, Green Velvet, DJ Godfather, David Clarke, DJ Slugo, & DJ Funk. These kingpins would occasionally drop filthy jacking ghetto records into their sets and the young impressionable producer fell in love with this sound. This booty based vibe went on to lay the foundation for Kill Frenzy’s initial releases on Ghetto Test (a subsidiary of the infamous Dust Traxx Records) and Juke Trax (DJ Godfather’s Ghetto Tech label). His rapid-fire juke joints, clocking around 160 BPM, were pure youthful adrenaline. /  / Not wanting to limit himself to just one style he started working on various other genres. Another EP was picked up immediately by Hervé of The Count of Monte Cristal with his Cheaper Thrills (UK) label. He continued to release tracks and remixes on various labels, flirting with different genres, while at the same time keeping that original ghetto house and booty flavour. /  / In 2012, Kill Frenzy signed to Claude VonStroke’s San Francisco based label dirtybird with his most well known release thus far, “Make That Booty Clap.” This massive record infected DJs as diverse as Soul Clap, Jamie Jones and Skrillex—the latter of whom helped turn this signature tune into a festival anthem. He went on to release several more records on dirtybird and became an important element in the very tight knit crew. /  / Taylr Swft, Kill Frenzy’s debut album on dirtybird, was described by label label boss VonStroke /  / as “ his secret weapon” that year. At one point he was playing seven tracks from the album in the same set - it was almost embarrassing! /  / Kill Frenzy has more recently released further tracks on dirtybird including 'Silo', 'Last Night'. Other releases include 'Break Loose' on Jackathon, 'Crystal Seed' on Turbo, and the ' 313 / I Feel EP' on Relief. His forthcoming single on W&O Street tracks '202' features Chambray is the one to watch out for in the coming months. /  / Last autumn Kill Frenzy is set to embark on a huge USA tour. Now armed with his own merchandise & T-Shirt range, Kill Frenzy’s diverse love for bizarre yet melodic, catchy underground house & techno is what has lured Djs and dancers worldwide, making him a force to be reckoned with. /  / ABOUT MDA EVENTS: /  / Known as one of Southern California’s premier independent promotion companies for over a decade, Modern Disco Ambassadors brings a unique blend of progressive and eclectic music to guests, featuring world-class international and national talent. /  / Join us for our weekly MDA Wednesdays event series at La Cave in Costa Mesa, Calif. 11 years and counting, MDA Wednesdays continues to bring national and international talent to a unique and intimate venue in the heart of Orange County.

2554,"SFV Acid, Shapiro, Circle K",2/27/2020,"Originally named “The Crossbow”, “The Barkley Restaurant” opened in 1951 at the corner of Huntington Drive and Fremont in South Pasadena, California. In 1993, the restaurant was purchased by the late radio humorist, Roger Barkley and was renamed ""The Barkley Restaurant"". In 1997, former waiter Carlos Quezada and busboy Luis Cruz purchased ""The Barkley Restaurant"". Soon after in 1999, a sandwich on the menu was named Award-Winning Basic Barkley after winning the “Best in L.A.” award by the Los Angeles Magazine. This friendly neighborhood restaurant is a favorite to locals, where customers feel right at home at its graceful curving semi-circular full bar and tables with neatly folded napkins and sparkling glasses. “The Barkley Restaurant” has been featured in many different publications, newspapers, magazines, blog spots, and other food reviews on the web.

Besides his original tracks, which have been featured in video games and movies, Mark also collaborated with Armin van Buuren, W&W and KSHMR to name a few. On the live front, the long-time DJ/Producer brought his highly energetic performances to the biggest venues and the world’s largest dance music festivals as Creamfields, TomorrowWorld, A State of Trance and Ultra Music Festival whilst gaining support from the majority of the top DJ’s in the world on his originals and monumental remixes. /  / As a born perfectionist and skilled artist, a remarkable and undeniably swift revolution marks the past few years of UK’s Jordan Suckley. Going from one of the scene’s most promising newcomers and a roar in the underground to playing the world’s high-end clubs, events and festivals, launching his very own Damaged Records and hitting the top of the charts with originals and remixes, is a mere reflection of the hard work this guy’s put into it.

2597,Rocky Hill Corps,2/29/2020,"Rocky Hill Corps return to Club Tee Gee for their monthly residency! /  / Rocky Hill Corps are based in Los Angeles and consists of members Arthur Kaplan, Gabe Lopez, and Darone Sassounian. /  / The name ‘Rocky Hill Corps’ is derived from Darone Sassounian’s management and booking label ‘Rocky Hill’, which also happens to be the name of the neighborhood he was born and raised in. The inclusion of the word ‘Corps’ is meant as a synonym for ‘unity or a body of people engaged in a particular activity.’ The inspiration behind Rocky Hill is Sassounian’s drive to bring both the sounds he was introduced to as a child, and the ones self-discovered from his bedroom, onto the dance floor: “Rocky Hill is my home; it’s where I grew up. It’s where I was introduced to my likes and dislikes, and where I feel the safest. That’s what I wish my colleagues and artists to feel.” Sassounian prefers to maintain a close knit and indie mindset when working with artists under his wing. /  / Arthur Kaplan and Gabe Lopez grew up in Miami together. They both studied Art and Design from an early age. Kaplan’s focus is Fabrication and Production Design, while Lopez’s focus is in Industrial Design. Both moved out to Los Angeles to pursue their careers a few years ago. Kaplan is the art director for Rocky Hill, while Lopez is a collaborative consultant. Darone Sassounian is born and raised in Los Angeles. He previously worked at Backside Records as a record buyer and Ubiquity Records as a label coordinator. He currently is the agent for artists such as, Bosq and Basil & Rogers. /  / The trio first met at a music venue in Los Angeles in 2016. Having similar tastes in music, the three began experimenting with sounds and started to play records they admired, all in the presence of good company. “The three of us are drawn towards many different sounds. When we play records together, there’s a natural cohesion of unique sounds that blend well with one another. It varies from afro boogie, disco, house, and techno. It’s all music with a soul; some rare and some not so rare.” /  / www.rockyhillrecords.us","Darone Sassounian, Arthur Kaplan and Gabe Lopez as Rocky Hill Corps",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1387956,Club Tee Gee,los angeles,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g32655-Activities-Los_Angeles_California.html,'34.1176619166667', '-118.260877791667'

Aaron’s artistic style defies all classification, driven by a groove rather than a strict devotion to one style or genre. Aaron’s eclectic and adventurous taste in tunes has kept audiences on their toes ever since he began DJ’ing in his hometown of Santa Fe, and his commitment to solid grooves and sounds has always kept the dance floor moving. He’s been on the move as well, traveling to new destinations in the US and Mexico while managing Wulfpack in Los Angeles and residencies at Burning Man’s legendary day parties at the DISTRIKT sound camp. Along with co-founder Jamie Schwabl, Aaron organizes the beast known as Wulfpack, one of Southern California’s most inclusive party crew. Under the Wulfpack banner, Aaron curates the Wulfcast guest mix series, their record label, and the event calendar. Wulfpack boasts an impressive and diverse roster, showcasing the incredible depth of talent in Southern California. In 2018, Wulfpack partnered with ChinoSound to throw the first Synergy Festival, a weekend of non-stop music in the Mojave desert, with the promise of more to come. Aaron has also been returning to his Drum n’ Bass roots with performances as his alter ego Aaron Jakobs, showcasing his range at bass music stages in addition to the groovy house and techno that has made him a staple of the underground. You can catch him out playing or partying any given day, soaking in the abundance of good.  /  / RA: https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/aaronjacobs / Soundcloud: soundcloud.com/aaronjacobswulfpack  / Instagram: @djaaronjacobs /  / ~ /  / MARIE NYX [XENOPHILE | BĀZEL] /  / Marie Nyx has an unmatched ability to adapt to the wants and needs of any dance floor without sacrificing her infectious, apparitional style.

From the warehouse to the desert to the nightclub, this true DJ will dazzle any and all who are lucky enough to be on the receiving end of her encyclopedic track selections, and soon dancers will receive her own equally eclectic productions as well. /  / RA: https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/marienyx / Soundcloud: www.soundcloud.com/marienyx / Instagram: @_marienyx","Lee K, Aaron Jacobs, Marie Nyx",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1393854,The Paramount,los angeles,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g32655-Activities-Los_Angeles_California.html,'34.04477', '-118.2039'

Celebrate with Cromie, Evade Robots, and the rest of the Low Recordings crew.  /  / Pre-Order on bandcamp: / www.lowrecordings.bandcamp.com /  / “VCF is Ricky Tinez's latest project and one he holds close to his heart where he explores sound recordings of his own with digital synthesis and samples from TV, adverts, and whatever else. His releases are few and far between but always high quality as he prefers to focus on getting each one absolutely perfect.  /  / Up first is 'J05', a deep and dubby house groove that's humid and atmospheric, with steamy pads and vinyl crackle all aging it to perfection. Next comes 'E06', a superbly vibe-fuelled wedge of well swung house music. The raw drums are embellished with warm and authentic chords while razor sharp hi hats and funky little guitar riffs add vital detail.  /  / Captain Supernova, a fictional Astronaut created by composer and arranger Eric Borders, then features on 'Breadkrumz.' This one has jazzy key playing tumbling down over the perfectly smooth drum loops and meaning bass. It's classic house with a contemporary air of cool that works on both head and heel.  /  / Remixing is Cromie, the Peach, Amadeus and Freerange associate who has a musical house sound that is all his own. Here he flips 'E06' into a busy and bristling track with sci-fi synths and streaming pads, noodling jazz riffs and a punchy beat that oozes funk.” /  / Here’s what some have said about the new upcoming EP: / Robert Owens - “Cool tracks!” /  / Rick Wade - “These tracks are real right! Definitely something I like vibing to!” /  / DJ Assassin - “Nice mood changers, a couple of useful track, will definitely play” /  / Korea Town Acid - “Lovely, Excellent, My cup of tea.

After a long wait he has now started to play his first ever live performances in Europe. /  / Ata Kak’s Obaa Sima cassette fell on deaf ears when it was first self-released in Ghana in 1994 but when American musicologist Brian Shimkovitz stumbled upon the tape at a street stall in Cape Coast, Ghana eight years later it became the stimulus for him to launch his Awesome Tapes from Africa blog, writing in his inaugural post: ' This is it. The song is called Moma Yendodo. You may never hear anything like this elsewhere. No one I know in Ghana listens to this frenetic leftfield rap madness.' The music on the recording - an amalgam of highlife, Twi-language rap, funk, hip-hop and electronica – traverses a pop music landscape that encapsulates international modes while reflecting contemporary Ghanaian music of the period. Presented with the sweaty passion of a Prince record and the lo-fi recording charm of early Chicago house music, Obaa Sima 's joyous soul and casual brilliance made the enigmatic Ata Kak an underground internet sensation and a party-starter the world over. After more than a decade of searching Brian finally tracked down the singer and released the LP officially in March 2015.",Ata Kak,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1360856,Lodge Room,los angeles,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g32655-Activities-Los_Angeles_California.html,'34.10918', '-118.19452'

2895,Kraftwerk 50th Anniversary 3-D Tour,6/24/2020,"After their worldwide hugely successful 3-D concert tours, the Electro pioneers Kraftwerk announce North American tour dates for summer 2020. Bringing together music, 3-D visuals and performance art, KRAFTWERK are a true „Gesamtkunstwerk„ a total work of art. /  / The multi-media project Kraftwerk was started in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. They set up their electronic Kling Klang Studio in Düsseldorf, Germany where they conceived and produced all Kraftwerk albums. By the mid-1970’s Kraftwerk had achieved international recognition for their revolutionary electronic‚ soundscapes and their musical experimentation with robotics and other technical innovations. With their visions of the future, Kraftwerk created the soundtrack for the digital age of the 21st century. Their compositions, using / innovative techniques, synthetic voices and computerized rhythms, have had a major / international influence across an entire range of music genres: from Electro to Hip Hop, from Techno to SynthPop. /  / In their live performances, Kraftwerk–Ralf Hütter, Henning Schmitz, Fritz Hilpert, Falk / Grieffenhagen–illustrate their belief in the respective contributions of both man and machine. Starting with the retrospective of their catalogue at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2012, in recent years Kraftwerk have returned full circle back to their origins within the Düsseldorf art scene of the late Sixties. The 3-D concert series at MoMA was followed by further presentations at Tate Modern Turbine Hall (London), Akasaka Blitz (Tokyo) Opera House (Sydney), Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles), Fondation Louis Vuitton (Paris), Neue National Galerie (Berlin) and Guggenheim Museum (Bilbao). In 2014 Ralf Hütter and his former partner were honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.",Kraftwerk,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1394899,Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall,los angeles,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g32655-Activities-Los_Angeles_California.html,'34.0224584092589', '-118.281563407358'

When they started off and what their influences were are inconsequential. Listing the popular venues they've played or name dropping artists that support them would be disingenuous. This is because a short anecdotal paragraph loaded with DJ/producer cliches wouldn't do their style, or their sound, any justice. The Cocodrills (Christian ""Pridef"" Diaz, Adam Cruz) pride themselves on creating a unique musical experience, which can only be just that; experienced. But make sure to leave your pretense at the door 'cause you won't find any bullshit at one of their parties; only funky grooves, positive vibes, and rampant debauchery. And while they don't claim to have reinvented the wheel, they do like to take that wheel down the road of sound for a ride so wild it wakes up the next morning with no tread smelling of burnt rubber and a wondrous sense of ""let's do that again!"".

2924,Kraftwerk 50th Anniversary 3-D Tour,7/8/2020,"After their worldwide hugely successful 3-D concert tours, the Electro pioneers Kraftwerk announce North American tour dates for summer 2020. Bringing together music, 3-D visuals and performance art, KRAFTWERK are a true „Gesamtkunstwerk„ a total work of art. /  / The multi-media project Kraftwerk was started in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. They set up their electronic Kling Klang Studio in Düsseldorf, Germany where they conceived and produced all Kraftwerk albums. By the mid-1970’s Kraftwerk had achieved international recognition for their revolutionary electronic‚ soundscapes and their musical experimentation with robotics and other technical innovations. With their visions of the future, Kraftwerk created the soundtrack for the digital age of the 21st century. Their compositions, using / innovative techniques, synthetic voices and computerized rhythms, have had a major / international influence across an entire range of music genres: from Electro to Hip Hop, from Techno to SynthPop. /  / In their live performances, Kraftwerk–Ralf Hütter, Henning Schmitz, Fritz Hilpert, Falk / Grieffenhagen–illustrate their belief in the respective contributions of both man and machine. Starting with the retrospective of their catalogue at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2012, in recent years Kraftwerk have returned full circle back to their origins within the Düsseldorf art scene of the late Sixties. The 3-D concert series at MoMA was followed by further presentations at Tate Modern Turbine Hall (London), Akasaka Blitz (Tokyo) Opera House (Sydney), Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles), Fondation Louis Vuitton (Paris), Neue National Galerie (Berlin) and Guggenheim Museum (Bilbao). In 2014 Ralf Hütter and his former partner were honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.",Kraftwerk,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1394944,Dr. Phillips Center,orlando,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g34515-Activities-Orlando_Florida.html,'28.5377867142857', '-81.3773009591837'

How they get you there is a heels over head traverse along the arc of a melting metronome, sometimes a few seconds long, sometimes an eternity. You land with each oscillation like a scrap of hay atop a stack of needles, a split second to yourself before their next tune plucks you by the ear, a comet tail of distortion streaming in your wake. If you haven't yet heard (and marvelled at the cover art) of their 2xLP on Fuck Yoga Records out of Macedonia, untwist yourself and figure it out fast. Consider it a metaphyical stretch before you're standing a few feet away from them inside the Peacock Lounge's Gold Room this Thursday. / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVGrzEnuPsU /  / Pandiscordian Necrogenesis / The compelling contraint of lo-fi metal becomes far more stark when further constrained to the blinding blur of just two arms, two legs, and one forked tongue. How it's possible for one soul to let loose this tightening vortex of darkness that warps, leans, stretches and still destroys with pinpoint resolve is a diabolical mystery. Pandiscordian Necrogenesis is the solo project of San Francisco's Ephemeral Domignostika and if's clearly too intense for the likes of a Henry Rollins' collection, the Tasmanian Devil listens to absolutely nothing else.

In 2000 he burst into the clubs and onto the charts with hit after hit on Electrik Soul, Siesta, Chez and Camouflage, emerging as one of the most sought-after DJs, remixers and producers in the scene. /  / In 2001 Joeski launched Maya Records, with releases like “Hustler’s Revenge” and his collaboration with DJ Chus on “El Amor” propelling the label onto the forefront of the U.S. house music sound that would become a global phenomenon and win him worldwide acclaim from clubbers and fellow DJs alike. /  / Demand for his studio skills grew exponentially over the next decade, with Joeski producing and remixing for the likes of NRK, Ministry of Sound, Defected, Bedrock, Nervous, Cajual and KMS ,helping catapult him further into the ranks of the house music elite. /  / Entering its 16th year, his Maya label continues a steady output of quality material that remain fixtures on the Beatport and Traxsource tech and deep house charts, with a robust release schedule that shows no signs of slowing any time soon. /  / January 2017 began with Joeski once again hard at work in the studio, teaming up with Harry Romero (as HR+Ski) on “Dem Tings” for Maya, working solo on “Lessons in Dub” for Poker Flat and also releasing the 14th installment in his “Maya Sessions” podcast on Pioneer DJ Radio. /  / The new music and remixes continued with the release of “Mind Function” on Maya and “Tribute to Obatala” on Crosstown Rebels, dropped by Pete Tong on his BBC Radio 1 show in February. /  / Joeski’s touring schedule continues to be as prolific as his studio output, headlining clubs from Acapulco to Helsinki plus a booked-out week spent at Miami Music Week 2017. In March all three tracks from “Tribute to Obatala” simultaneously climbed onto Beatport’s Tech House Top 100, with Joeski ending the month as featured artist on John Digweed’s “Transitions” podcast. /  / New music continued to flow in April including the release of Dancing in Space” on Kinetika and “Deep Elements EP” on Kitball, while “Mind Function” on Maya climbed into the Traxsource Tech House Top-10. Returning home from a tour of Mexico Joeski hit the studio once again, jamming with SF’s legendary Doc Martin on an upcoming collaboration and putting the finishing touches on his next solo Maya release. /  / This summer Joeski will once again be a fixture on the global tour circuit with performances at both Do Not Sleep and Dennis Ferrer’s Misfits Party in Ibiza, extensive tours of Australia, New Zealand, South America and Europe while back stateside he and Harry Romero continue their monthly Yage night at Brooklyn’s Output. /  / Fueled by his genuine love of the music, there’s no doubt that Joeski will continue to evolve both behind the decks and in the studio, captivating new generations of club-goers and maintaining his place as one of dance music’s most enduring talents. /  / ABOUT BLACK V NECK  /  / For far too long there have been records, attitudes, and even wardrobe choices that have been duplicated in the hopes of fitting in; Black V Neck paves their own path through their eclectic, intuitive, and original works without creative restrictions. /  / Miami natives Black V Neck are the perfect fit for those who enjoy music that is / inventive, stimulating and original.

The set was unequivocally goosebump-inducing, met with rave reviews from all the ravers. At that moment, they knew they were on to something. On that fateful day, the two audiophiles got ridiculously tipsy and found their groove through a shared love of funky, fun, frivolous vibes...and Fernet. After closing out their electric set, the tipsy twosome came up with a hilarious moniker. Unfortunately this name was never recorded...and never remembered. “Silky Thunder” is the closest approximation of this earth-shattering epithet they could recall….and it stuck.  /  / Now the pair snuggle up behind the decks on the regular, pumping out sets that keep the dance floor swaying and swerving for hours on end.

The Swedish artist has a distinct approach to life, as well as music, which is centred around tranquillity, stillness and the convergence of Zen meditation, nature and creativity. Known for his work as one half of Minilogue, Sebastian is also an accomplished solo artist with new material ready to roll. As an artist that is constantly evolving he has taken a bold new direction in his sonic exploration, immersing himself in the neo-classical scene and joining forces with one of the top 10 philharmonic orchestras in the world - Tonhalle Zürich. Working with great care and innovation he has created a truly immersive audio-visual performance experience, combining a mesmerising integration of electronic and classical instrumentation, with a visual art installation based on breath taking nature landscapes shot from a helicopter perspective. With such an innovative approach he aims to bridge the gap between classical and electronic music and introduce a whole new generation to the neo-classical concept. / Sebastian's deep connection with music can be traced back to his formative years; from playing the organ and violin as a child, to performing in orchestras, string quartets and pop bands and progressing into electronic music in his late teens. Discovering house and techno in the mid- nineties was the catalyst behind a revolution in his life, he set out on a new musical pathway, to promote the simplicity of being. Throughout the late nineties he experimented with electronic sounds, forming cult duo Minilogue with a friend and releasing with Crosstown Rebels, Traum Schallplatten, Wagon Repair and more, plus two albums via Cocoon – ‘Animals’ (2008) and ‘Blomma’ (2013). In 2014, the duo decided to take a break and invest their time in solo projects and Sebastian has since been hard at work cultivating a collection of new music already snapped up by hugely influential labels such as R&S sub-label Apollo, Drumcode, Hypercolour and Minus. / Sebastian Mullaert’s live performances are awe-inspiring, combining technical wizardry with energy, atmosphere and euphoria, you only have to watch his “Interpretations” performance for XLR8R or Boiler Room appearance for examples of his prowess. Recognition of his aptitude has led him to perform at institutions and festivals such as Panorama Bar - Berlin, Labyrinth Festival - Japan, Fabric - London, Concrete - Paris, The Block - Tel Aviv and Blackmarket - NYC. / > / VRIL (Dystopian / Giegling / Delsin, Berlin) / Berlin-based Vril, amassed a following in 2011 when his track “UV” appeared on Marcel Fengler’s Berghain 05 compilation. He also garnered the attention of Marcel Dettmann in 2014 when he ended his fabric 77 mix with “Torus XXXII,” taken from Vril’s Torus LP. He has since continued to release music with Semantica and Giegling and brings his stunning live sets to venues across the world. /  / - - - - /  / 21+ | No Refunds | ATMs on site / Sound by Funktion-One (Official) / Stay connected: publicsf.com/connect","Sebastian Mullaert, Vril",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1364558,Public Works,san francisco,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60713-Activities-San_Francisco_California.html,'37.7689950686633', '-122.419558579827'

His musical journey commenced at 16, when he started experimenting with toy pianos and pretty much anything that could produce notes. Before long he was playing his father’s vinyls and from here, quickly advanced to DJing and producing. / Initially producing drum & bass as well as trance, Nick Devon later transitioned his sound, gravitating towards electronica and techno.

This admirable skill has earned him much respect from numerous high profile artists worldwide. As a former vinyl DJ, Nick is also an avid record collector and to this day, spins plenty of old and new records. /  / In 2010, Nick officially launched his solo project and started producing sounds and music that shook the dance floor, yet bestowed captivating melodies and emotional soundscapes, allowing people to create their own story within his productions. From this point forward, Nick’s career swiftly evolved. In 2015, he released two huge EP’s titled “The Poem” and “Cosmos”. His remix on Innellea - Colante quickly followed in 2016 and with all three EP’s released on Steyoyoke Recordings, it clearly affirmed just why he is considered a core member of the Berlin based collective. His tracks have been remixed by the likes of Kellerkind, Rolland Appel and Cid Inc and with an ever growing fan base, his music is regularly played and supported by some of the biggest DJs around the globe.

That’s right our favorite up all night and day raver is turning 50 and we are throwing him a party at the Great Northern. /  / Our fabulous lineup: / Jozif: / After breaking through with ­ what are still standout releases on labels like Wolf + Lamb, Mobilee & Ministry of Sound back in 2010, alongside an RA podcast that comprised solely of re­writes, edits and productions ­ The last 6 years we have seen Londoner jozif cement himself as a unique musical voice in the world of electronic music. / Far from just programming beats that make you jack, his music is some of the most beautiful you will hear, with lush string arrangements, emotive pianos and golden synths coming together into soundscapes that will melt your heart as well as warm your soul. Building on the early success of releases like the Sunrise EP on InFiné, the first releases on Fist or Finger (the label he co­runs with fabric’s Craig Richards) and the summer anthem that was ‘Twilight’ with vocalist Terri Walker on More Music, jozif was unsurprisingly snapped up by LA’s suitably sultry Culprit records for a brace of EPs. Here he further refined his richly musical style with genre defying with releases like ‘Standard Rising’, the ‘Lady B’ EP and now the two­part Waikiki anthem. / Since then he has been enlisted by the cultured likes of Mobilee, Suol and Compost for remixes, and the way he carefully permeates his music with such serene and slo­-mo ambiance yet imbues each track with a cheeky dance floor bump has seen everyone from Sasha to Giles Peterson, Andrew Weatherall to Damian Lazarus fall in love. / Having been a DJ since as far back as 1996, it made sense that the legendary Balance series came calling for jozif when they wanted to kick­off a new mix series in early 2013. What he turned in was a stunningly emotional and heartfelt mix that proved just how sensitive and soothing electronic music can be, at the same time, of course, as subtly making you move your body. For proof of his artistic ability in the booth, you only need ask anyone who has seen him play at places like Space Ibiza, Verboten New York & London’s foremost fabric and many other festivals around Asia and both Americas. / Currently putting the final touches to his debut artist album and accompanying Live show, whilst simultaneously Co­writing the Kerb Staller debut album & Live show alongside cohort and production partner Matt Tolfrey, 2016 is shaping up to be a ‘Live’ one. Coupled with releases on Music for Freaks, Exploited and the resurgence of Fist or Finger, as well his continued world wide residencies at Bedrock & Desert Hearts – jozif shows no signs of slowing down. /  / Ray and Nikita: / Ray Zuniga! /  / Label owner, producer, record selector, and gentleman of the LIVING night. A Dj who refuses to be restricted by genre, Zuniga’s music brings you the full spectrum. His / sets range from the finest house and techno, to electronica and disco.

Their events started as an underground in Brooklyn, and they’ve taken the brand to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Europe for Amsterdam Dance Event for the past two years. In 2018, WeArePulse declared LIVING as one of the best events of the week! / As Zuniga’s reputation continues to garner attention for the maturity of his sound coupled with an uncanny ability to create instantly accessible dancefloor vibes, he occupies a unique position in the musical ecosystem. Independent of any hip or hyped musical movements. With releases on Nervous Records, Leftroom, Culprit, Wolf + Lamb, Serkal, and his own Touch of Class, he is now working diligently in the studio on his solo and LIVING project, while also co-operating the Touch of Class Records label. An imprint dedicated to presenting timeless music appreciated by any connoisseur of sound. /  / Nikita Never Stops!  / On the same day Dolly Parton, Janis Joplin, Edgar Allan Poe, his mother and grandmother were born, so too did San Francisco DJ, NIKITA, begin his enchanted existence. As a young boy in Denver, Colorado, NIKITA's childhood was similar to that of other extraordinary creative youth; days filled with church and show choir, playing the piano, and dancing to his mother's R&B albums. From an early age, NIKITA always knew he wanted to be an entertainer. Then, in 1993, a chance encounter with house music at an underground warehouse party would prove to be a pivotal moment in his life, ultimately guiding NIKITA towards the charmed life he lives today. /  / It wasn't until the turn of the millennium though that NIKITA would leave his home in Colorado to search the clubs and warehouses of San Francisco for his destiny. At the very least, he would get a degree in Music Business from San Francisco State University. But with a resounding perseverance and an inimitable personality, NIKITA quickly earned his place among the upper echelon of DJs in San Francisco's world-renowned club scene. In 2005, NIKITA was chosen to host his own radio show, The Massive Mix, on Northern California's only electronic dance music radio station, Energy 92.7 FM. Indeed, it was NIKITA's penchant for blending raw grooves with sophisticated sounds that garnered him a residency at San Francisco's legendary nightclub, The EndUp. Today NIKITA credits SF as the city that made him the adult and artist that he is today... / NIKITA is a DJ's DJ, a rare soul who truly understands his role in the DJ booth. Performing anywhere from two to eighteen hour sets, NIKITA weaves music into fantastic journeys of rhythm and sound. NIKITA's ability to contrast the harder elements of techno with the soulful sensuality of deep house has garnered him accolades from some of the world's best DJs and allowed him the rare opportunity to tag team alongside the likes of Cassy, Danny Howells, Lee Burridge, and Derek Plaslaiko. Indeed, NIKITA has played with a Who's Who of international talent, including Danny Tenaglia, M.A.N.D.Y., Joel Mull, Adam Beyer, Craig Richards, Steve Bug, Damian Lazurus, Steve Lawler, and many, many more. With additional inspiration coming from friends such as Ms. Honey Dijon, Tedd Patterson and Danny Tenaglia, it comes as no wonder why NIKITA's story is one of a dream come true. /  / Today, NIKITA and music partner, RAY ZUNIGA (Co-founder and label owner of ​Touch of Class Records​), produce an international music experience called LIVING.us.

3082,Ritual SF Returns fe,2/1/2020,"Ritual, San Francisco’s premier bass music event returns on Feb 1st at DNA Lounge! Nebakaneza and Johnny 5 were just two random DJs who were obsessed with music of all kinds, but what brought them together was their love of Dubstep, and bass heavy music. They met online after hyping each other up, because they listened to each other’s mixes so much. They got a gig together one night at a tiny club in Oakland, and everyone there seemed to think their music was too weird. It didn’t matter to them though. They immediately became close friends, and eventually brothers. They formed a partnership and decided to start throwing their own weird events in San Francisco that would cater to other like minded weirdos. They worked their asses off, and just kept booking more and more of their favorite weirdos. What started in a gritty hole in the wall in 2010, blossomed into the biggest reoccurring bass event in the country.  /  / Ritual has hosted over 200 events, booked nearly 600 artists, and at our peak had up to 700 attendees every week. We expanded into LA, worked with festivals, threw big off-shoot events, and collaborated with many other major promoters. This party has always been fueled by the people who attend it, and we have been insanely lucky by our amazing crowd who became our friends over the years. There were never any fights at Ritual, and although scenes come with their share of dramas, our crowd has always been all about the music. We kept our events affordable so nearly everyone had access, and we learned everyone’s name because we had genuine conversations and experiences. You all became our family. We never had a separate line for guest list because we never wanted anyone to feel less important than anyone else. Without you, we are nothing, and we are excited to re-capture that magic once again. /  / RITUAL ROOM: / Antiserum: / https://soundcloud.com/antiserum / Gladkill: / https://soundcloud.com/gladkill / Nebakaneza / https://soundcloud.com/nebakaneza / Johnny 5: / https://soundcloud.com/Johnny5dubstep / Elevener: / https://soundcloud.com/elvnrstep / Filthgrinder: / https://soundcloud.com/filthgrinder / White Gravy: / https://soundcloud.com/white_gravy /  / 2ND ROOM (House/Bass): / Switchblade: / https://soundcloud.com/187switchblade / Danny Weird: / https://soundcloud.com/dannyweird / Mr. Brandon: / https://soundcloud.com/mrbrandon / Sneakerz: / https://soundcloud.com/dothedaft5555 / Nightware: / https://soundcloud.com/nightwarez /  / Bootie Room with Hubba Hubba  / (Onesie Night) / John Beaver: / https://soundcloud.com/djjohnbeaver / Adrian A: / http://bootiemashup.com/ / and more /  / Hip Hop Lounge (hosted by Bootie DJs) / DJs TBA /  / Our entrance will be through the smaller door, to the left of DNA Pizza.

3109,"Nox Vahn, Simon Doty & Luigi Sambuy Anjunadeep 11",2/8/2020,"ABOUT NOX VAHN: / Nox Vahn first began his journey under the alias ‘Fairchild.’ His prior name might have a familiar ring to it, and that’s because Fairchild first burst onto the underground music scene in 2015 by catching the attention of internationally-acclaimed DJ and Grammy-nominated music producer, Kaskade, who began to release and support Fairchild’s music on his newly founded record label, Arkade. /  / The young, classically-trained musician was immediately recognized on a global scale as an exceptionally exciting electronic-music-producer to watch, promptly earning him support from a wide range of the biggest names in dance music history including Above & Beyond, Paul Oakenfold, Hernan Cattaneo, Sander Van Doorn, Henry Saiz, Lane 8, Eelke Kleijn, Jeremy Olander, and a nod from the “Pied Piper of Dance” himself, Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1. /  / Soon, word of the up-and-coming American artist made its way across the pond where he was picked up by London based record labels, Anjunadeep & Anjunabeats. The powerhouse sister-labels both went on to feature a total of 5 of the aspiring American’s productions as standout moments in their chart-topping and legendary compilation albums in Anjunadeep 9 & 10 and most recently, Anjunabeats vol. 14. /  / In early 2019, the musician announced a brand change, citing complications with the name ‘Fairchild’. In an open statement, he genuinely explained the struggles he’s had and reassured fans that the branding changes would have no impact on his sound or style, stating “I’m still making whatever music I would have made as Fairchild. It’s still me in the studio, only now, I have a new name and brand I can call my own. It’s something I 100% believe in and can feel confident operating in for years to come.” /  / The highly-anticipated alias reveal was met with excitement and interest from fans and industry professionals alike. When asked how he came up with the name, he mysteriously responded that he felt like ‘Nox Vahn’ chose him, and not the other way around. /  / He would go on to perform at some of the most legendary venues in the United States including Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado, and the Brooklyn Mirage in New York; while supporting names like Kaskade, Above & Beyond, and Lane 8 on tour; and continuing to see highly successful releases on labels such as Kaskade’s Arkade, and London based powerhouse label, Anjunadeep. /  / Clearly, Nox has proven himself worthy of a seat at the underground table. He has vowed to continue to explore the depths of his mind and electronic music - and with his heavy progressive influence and signature dark sound, he will continue to win the hearts and minds of people around the world - a shining beacon calling out to all of those who will listen /  / ABOUT SIMON DOTY: / Over the last six years, Simon Doty has become one of the most prolific producers on the scene. Working with imprints such as Einmusika, Stil vor Talent, Sincopat, and Steyoyoke; Simon has pushed the boundaries of his sound while also becoming a staple in the touring circuit.

A year later came the release which marked a milestone for Perfect Stranger – “Changed” – a remix CD which gave rise to some of the most epic tunes which still reign dancefloors today.

Under these aliases you’ll find sweeping emotive cuts, verdantdancefloor workouts and discerning dips into jungle and breaks. Releaseshave come on respected labels including Meda Fury, Ectotherm, UN.T.O andLobster Fury: the collaborative label from Lobster Theremin and Meda Furybegun for the explicit purpose of releasing his tracks.DJ Seinfeld’s beats are ultimately guided by an idea of authenticity, true to thespirit of the early house pioneers and the unabashed rawness the confines oftheir equipment demanded. A lot’s been made of this lo-fi fuzz, with manyclamoring to declare it a scene, but he won’t be put into a box. His path is hisown. A microphone picks up the tension and release of a singer: charged withemotion, the machine can’t handle it. The rough edges of his productions emitthe same sensibility.Footage of his gigs or their post-show reaction exemplifies the reception hegets as a DJ. Biographies often claim a DJ regularly ‘sends crowds intorapture’ or ‘lays waste to the floor,’ but in DJ Seinfeld’s case pandemonium isthe default. Mixes show his deft control of build-up and feel in the booth, whilehis mini series for legendary London station Rinse FM in May ‘DJ Seinfeldpresents…’, was a master class in the kind of wonky left-field house hepeppers his sets with.Armand began making music in Edinburgh at the suggestion of a respectedfriend. Time spent experimenting with sounds and exploring the possibilitiescontained within his laptop was cathartic relief from the grind of finishing hisstudies. Later returning to his hometown of Malmo, his interest in makingmusic would intensify thanks to encouragement from his old school friendsand the looming spectre of a 9-5 lifestyle. A move to Barcelona and the end ofa relationship resulted in extended sessions watching the classic Americansitcom and the music made to reflect that appeared under the name DJSeinfeld.Rimbaudian already had traction and DJ Seinfeld was really intended as aside-project to exorcise emotions felt at that time. At first, tracks appeared onmusic-sharing groups online but he didn’t claim ownership, despite thegrowing buzz. When his friend Courtesy’s label Ectotherm began asking whothe mysterious producer was, he began to take note. Then before long,Lobster Theremin and Media Fury followed suit.The point of no return though came one evening spent with Ableton and a fewbeers. The track ‘U’ was uploaded to Soundcloud, and the internet went intooverdrive. Sampling Bob Geldoff’s account of his split with his wife, amidsoaring chants and keys wrought in heartache, ‘U’ is almost voyeuristic in itshonesty. It’s that truth, that realness, that defines what Armand’s music isabout.","DJ Seinfeld, Vin Sol, DJ PATRICK, COMPUTER DATA, illusive, suade, feelé, Eug",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1375514,The Gre,san francisco,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60713-Activities-San_Francisco_California.html,'37.7676612', '-122.4065246'

Growing up in the Bay Area club culture as a dancer, Coflo’s obsession with music drove him to the explore the inner-workings of sound, musical composition and the art of a club DJ. This wanting to understand more drove Coflo to study music in basic theory, production, instrumentation etc… In an effort to further his knowledge in dance through music, Coflo began to fall in love with the art of music production. Through friendship with local dancer/producer Stephen Rigmaiden; Coflo was shown some of Stephen’s trade secrets of house music production. Since these basic beginnings Coflo has grown in both dance and music production through the decades. Known as one of America’s best “house dancers” of a new generation; Coflo now has published remixes and original productions on King Street; Ocha Records and MoBlack Records.

3137,"Khen (Anjunadeep, Bedrock) + Verlk (Bedrock)",2/14/2020,"ABOUT KHEN: The jury is in and the likes of Guy J, Sasha, industry media and an exponentially growing fan base across the globe are in agreement; all signs point to who the next big thing to come out of the dance music hot bed that is Israel will be. /  / Content with shouldering the pressure that comes with lofty praise and hailing from Tel Aviv, a city with an astounding lineage of dance music greats in Guy Mantzur, Guy Gerber, Shlomi Aber, Sahar Z and confidant Guy J, this wunderkind has carved out a path of his own while staying true to his heritage. With a hypnotic and emotionally charged style that blends early 2000s progressive with house grooves and elements of contemporary techno, Khen possesses a truly idiosyncratic sound that transcends genre. /  / Going back to when it at all began, Khen immersed himself in the world of dance music at an early age under the tutelage of his older brother. When not busy learning how to play the piano, 6-year-old Khen mixed records using two cassette decks. When he stood before a set of Technics 1210s for the first time, he was yet to blow out the candles on the day of his 9th birthday. /  / He was also gifted with an almost unsettling production talent and was encouraged to start spending time in the studio at age 11. Instantly spellbound by the process, he spent all his spare time in front of a Moog synth instead of the playground. A buzz amongst the house and techno faithfuls in Tel Aviv started building, and the scene began to yearn for the young prodigy to showcase his productions on a dance floor. He obliged and ended up playing his debut club show at merely 15 at Tel Aviv’s legendary Dome venue. /  / After years of honing his skills both in the studio and behind the decks, his music hit the ears of Guy Mantzur in 2011, who promptly signed him to his Plattenbank imprint. Proving to become a catalyst event, the then 22-year-old Khen regained his determination to pursue music. Since then he has released on labels in the likes of Nick Warren’s Hope, Hernan Cattaneo’s Sudbeat, Guy J’s Lost & Found, Jeremy Olander’s Vivrant, John Digweed’s Bedrock and microCastle. /  / On the club end, the most coveted DJ booths in the world he once yearned to stand in are now his second home. With his allure growing beyond the shores of his home country in recent years, he has visited revered venues in the likes of Bahrein, Sound, Monochrome, Ministry of Sound, Pacha, Chips, Halcyon, Schimanski, Silver & Smoke and more. /  / He saw his international breakthrough in 2016 when he released his critically acclaimed debut album ”One Day of Independence” on Guy J’s Lost & Found. The LP saw support from the likes of Pete Tong, Noir, Dubfire, Joris Voorn, Hernan Cattaneo, Jeremy Olander, Paco Osuna and made the coveted number 1 spot on the overall releases chart in mere days. /  / Khen started 2017 with a debut US tour at Schimanski in New York City, Sound in Los Angeles and Halycon in San Fransisco and released massive debut EPs on Vivrant and Bedrock. Infinite praise from industry institutions such as DJ Mag and Mixmag followed, and it was no surprise the influential Dancing Astronaut named him an ”Artist to watch in 2017” alongside Yotto, ANNA and Enrico Sangiuliani. Mixmag opted to feature him in their “Impact” segment that highlights high momentum talent and has previously played host to budding superstars Lauren Lo Song, Cristoph, Peggy Gou and Julia Govor to name a few. /  / With this in mind, there’s no wonder that he caught UK legend John Digweed’s eyes and ears. ”Baby Steps” was Khen’s debut on Digweed’s power house label Bedrock, and you can surely have a worse coming out party on a new label. Two of the three tracks cracked the overall Beatport Top 100 and stayed at the top of the charts for weeks and left the Bedrock fan base longing for more. /  / Going from strength to strength in 2017 with a lot more to bring to the table, all signs point to 2018 becoming an even bigger year for Khen. With an arsenal of remixes on Noir, Bedrock and originals on Lost & Found as well as other unnamed labels, the crown is there for the taking for this phenom pegged as the next big thing.","Khen, Verlk",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1379618,251 Club,san francisco,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60713-Activities-San_Francisco_California.html,'37.766752', '-122.402438'

There is no definitive sound attached to the label, but rather each release is carried out as a focussed individual project, receiving its own distinct direction and treated with the utmost care and attention to detail. A long time DJ, Eug took on the role of “party promoter” due to not finding the exact party he wanted to frequent. He would start the party FACE in 2007, aiming to bridge the gap between San Francisco’s bar and club scenes. After outgrowing its small dive bar origins, Eug moved the party into larger club venues where he has hosted notables such as DJ Harvey, James Murphy, Massive Attack, 2Many DJ’s, Jamie XX, Daniele Baldelli and many more. Regardless of the size and nature of the venue, the music policy has always been about mixing things up and offering plenty of variety. This philosophy of musical diversity and anything goes, would eventually birth the FACE party mantra - “Its not a genre, it's a feeling”. /  / JEREMY CASTILLO (Club Lonely | SF) / https://soundcloud.com/jeremy_castillo /  / Club Lonely resident, Soo Wavey familia, and all around house fiend, Jeremy Castillo plays house the way it's meant to be heard -- loud. With a nod to the classic midwestern house sound, the SF native beats up the dance floor with everything from classic to contemporary jacking house, NJ/NY garage, intimate italo disco vocal cuts, and hidden gems awaiting the right moment of the evening. Wherever he's at, you'll find him behind the decks dropping fog machine floor fillers for the heads, freaks, and everyone in between. /  / STEVE C (Maas and Stacks | SF) /  / Everything you’ve heard is true... /  / - - - - /  / 21+ | No Refunds | ATMs on site / Sound by Funktion-One (Official) / Stay connected: publicsf.com/connect / Ticket transfers: bigneon.com /  / Public Works - The Loft / 161 Erie Street | SF, CA 94103","Kenji Takimi, Eug, Jeremy Castillo, and Steve C",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1375271,Public Works,san francisco,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60713-Activities-San_Francisco_California.html,'37.7689950686633', '-122.419558579827'

He hasn’t been back since 2018 so IT IS TIME for some Paul Johnson. /  / Link to our Facebook event here: /  / His dj sets are extremely diverse, just like all his productions. He flips between styles with ease and fluid progression always connected to the crowd. He’s blown the panties off Housepitality’s hoot and hollerin’ crowds with tracks you might never imagined Paul would play. You never really know what to expect from this fully engaged Chicago house music veteran. He has never stopped rocking parties. House music is his life and YOU are lucky enough to get a dose of his dance floor mastery. /  / Paul Johnson blowing the roof off Housepitality in 2012! / One more thing, Paul Johnson has produced more classic underground party jams than almost any other underground dance music artist. That is why the title of this article is “Paul Johnson’s Chicago House,” because he’s most undoubtedly helped define the Chicago House sound multiple times over the eras. Real talk! Below is a representative You Tube subscriber’s playlist compilation. It features 189 favorite Paul Johnson cuts that represent all sorts of styles that he’s heralded since the early 90’s. I just had to post this because I briefly looked at it and was reminded how much he’s done.. /  / This night is extra special because we also honor Mr. Mike Bledsoe’s Bday. He’s originally from the midwest and is the founder of the Housebroken crew. He is also a versatile and talented dj who’s been rocking deep Bay Area house spots since moving here 2.5 years ago. He has very diligently put his crew and events on the map and you might find him and his crew rolling the streets handing out flyers for their events while donning their branded hats. Respect! They are constantly adding more bookings to their schedule and for all that, we thank Mike Bledsoe for adding his love of house music to the local Bay Area scene. So, give it up for Mr. Bledsoe and the Housebroken family as they come bless up Housepitality on this night.

Tape manipulations and extended electronics form a densely droning backdrop from which emerges well-placed interventions of decipherable instruments, briefly sounding off in kaleidoscopic fashion before being submerged back into the muck.

Quickly, the question becomes why is it laughing, why is it rising, and how fast can you backpeddle without stumbling in instead? The newest bran(...)pos cassette, Cosmic Mushmouth, is that beast now breeching, face of a cosby kid, airborne before you, drool arcing in the sun above its scaley writhing seraph body of nose toothed prick eyed tongue hole. It has something to let you in on, real soon. Anyone who glimpsed the lights-out mutlichannel dispersion of his ""Martian Brine Pool"" at this year's SF Tape Music festival can tell you: This is no time to save yourself... down the hatch, plate yourself properly, at the Peacock Lounge 02/20/2020 @20:00:00 aka 8pm / https://branpos.bandcamp.com/album/cosmic-mushmouth /  / Ralph White (Austin, TX) / An erstwhile tree-doctor who picked up and left Texas after extending his techniques to include that cauliflower in your skull, the roots of which he'll steer to dislodge the stone in your chest. Apart from being a living druid, Ralph White was inducted to the Austin Music Hall of Fame as a core member of the legendary trio, Bad Livers. He's explored ancient music in remote regions of Namibia, Australia, Mexico and Louisiana and now lives an itinerant life not confined to four dimensions. “His solo work is possessed of a lonesome spark, exaggerating the implied drone at the heart of the music of Dock Boggs and The Stanley Brothers... playing wooden six-string banjo, violin, accordion and kalimba, his voice has a high, eerie quality... extremely psychedelic"" -(David Keenan, The Wire UK) / https://ralphewhite.com/music /  / Junior Mint Prince / Extracting holy sounds from the god of the gut, Lula Asplund and Naomi Harrison-Clay play as if all the world, and all that is hidden by the world, is open to their grasp. And it is. They'll collage together strings and electronic toys with soft screams to terraform new timbres for their next-century freak-folk post-topia where raw voices may bridge chaotic bursts of electronic processing and analog synthesis. Junior Mint Prince doesn't reach in order to transcend the vortex but to vascularize new paths within its churn, exposing new paths between the dense thicket of noise and the soft moment of having feet on the ground, embodying characters from the subconscious as the means to greet them at the door. Yeah, knock knock. / https://juniormintprince.bandcamp.com/ /  / Kanoko Nishi-Smith & Gabby Fluke-Mogul / Exquisitely attuned, foremost to people and then to resonant matter, objects that extend and entwine shared presence of mind, Kanoko Nishi-Smith is a collaborator nonpareil. Her extended technique on bass koto arises first from interior states requiring a suitably enormous instrument and her array of material surfaces with which to sound it. Her most apt collaborator on this night, Gabby Fluke-Mogul, sounds the shorter strings of the violin to invoke power of receiving. Fluke-Mogul is a master of listening as resonance, learning as loving, bringing depth to our experience of sound hues, of infinite timbres, of trust, of vulnerability and of desire. Together, this duo is an ocean that includes the sky. / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2XNxMRVgxA","bran(...)pos, Ralph White, Junior Mint Prince, Kanoko Nishi-Smith, Gabby Fluke-Mogul",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1387671,Peacock Lounge,san francisco,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60713-Activities-San_Francisco_California.html,'37.7721064', '-122.4313888'

Follow our Facebook and Instagram pages to find out how you could win a ticket to Movement Electronic Music Festival 2020 in Detroit. /  / Consent & safety are key at our parties. If you or anyone is made to feel uncomfortable during the night for any reason, please find one of the promoters or staff members at F8 and we will be more than happy to assist you ♥ /  / 21+ /  / ________________________________________________________ /  / About Drumcell: /  / Drumcell was born as Moe Espinosa in Los Angeles’ San Gabriel Valley. Far away from the glamour and glitter of Hollywood he cut his teeth growing up in a vibrant, diverse neighborhood and still draws inspiration from this cultural melting pot. It also remains the area where he and the Raíz brothers Vangelis and Vidal – who together founded the Droid Behavior events collective in the early 2000s – hang out and regularly plot their widely known and respected Interface warehouse events. /  / A classically trained musician in his youth, Moe came to circulate around the Noise, Punk and Industrial scene, playing guitar and singing in various bands until he discovered the early ’90s L.A. rave scene. He fell in love with this music and immediately dove deeper to find out how it was made. That was when he got in touch with some of the heroic synthesizers of Techno’s early years. His enthusiasm for those exciting, synthetic sounds was beyond words, and the following years he hardly left the studio of his day job to work on his own productions in a little back room at night. When he handed out his first self-produced, self-pressed vinyl’s at the Electronic Music Festival in Detroit and some of the DJs played his record the very next day on various stages, he was chuffed and ready to go all the way. /  / Even though he has become one of the more popular Techno artists in the North American scene, you can still hear his Industrial and Noise roots in everything he is doing. His debut album “Sleep Complex” – which was released on CLR – is characterized by a complete disregard for genre limitations and is everything but a conventional Techno album. Drumcell is a science-fiction-movies-loving technology geek with a Punk Rock soul, who has explored and discovered the analogue world as much as the digital world of music production, to finally combine them into his very own raw, suspenseful and hypnotic style. He is literarily addicted to analog synthesis and spends countless hours in his studio, ceaselessly experimenting and searching for new, mind-expanding sounds. /  / Drumcell has played at numerous prestigious venues worldwide, from Berlin´s Techno mecca Berghain to the main stage of the Movement festival in Detroit. His label Droid Recordings and his own releases have captured the attention of many of the world’s top Techno jocks. Drumcell has come full circle and is ready for a whole new chapter of what he is best at and what matters most to him in life – the manifestation of truthful emotions in futuristic sonic concepts.","Main Room reinforced with Funktion-One sound:, Drumcell (Observe, Dystopian / LA), Anthony Jimenez (Blank Code, Alterity, Robot Ears), Lindsey Herbert (Ascetic Limited, Alterity, Robot Ears), , Lounge hosted by Baba Yaga's Lair:, Ivana Smith, Eichef",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1341595,F8 1192 Folsom,san francisco,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60713-Activities-San_Francisco_California.html,'37.775296', '-122.410074'

Mouracade's roots reach as far back as the Southern California punk scene that gave rise to an equally as rich underground club world in the 90s. He studied jazz improvisation and music theory in college, at which time he bought his first samplers and sequencers. In the process, Alexandre got a severe addiction to buying records and finding old synths to record and learn from. / Mouracade's music and DJ sets reflect his passion for digging deep and not sticking to a specific genre - but by finding those tracks that have a timelessness to fit any moment on the dance floor. /  / Since 2012, Split Secs landed on various charts and track listings when the duo’s first EP “I’m Not Losin’” (Jolly Jams) earned heavy rotation worldwide.

3206,"Agents of Time (Afterlife) Live, Extended Set",2/23/2020,"ABOUT AGENTS OF TIME  /  / Agents Of Time is the project of Andrea Di Ceglie, Fedele Ladisa and Luigi Tutolo. A revered three­man live act, DJs, masters of their sound in the studio and founders of the Obscura record label. / Since starting their journey together as Agents Of Time, the three Italians have combined their talents and shared influences to become a globally in­demand dance act, releasing on a number of leading labels along the way. A much­loved debut 12” on Correspondent in 2014, ‘Polina’, marked them out as an exciting new name in the realm of emotional, melodic techno and kickstarted their touring career. / A hardware­heavy, improvisational live set spanning house, techno and acid is at the heart of what they do. The three members perform around a square table, facing each other, translating a symbiotic energy through the machines and communicating through instinct and gesture. A complex, unique and unpredictable dance between human minds and analog equipment that invariably creates moments of magic. Their live set was partly inspired by an expert of the craft in Mathew Jonson, and it is telling of Agents Of Time’s success that they now count Jonson as a collaborator. ‘Repeating Patterns, Numbers and Letters’, Agents Of Time’s first studio collaboration with Jonson came out in March 2019, following live shows together at Rex Club (Paris) and Movement Festival (Torino). / Agents Of Time’s DJ set, for which the three members alternate to form a duo, allows them to express the same vision through a more eclectic medium. The adventurous spirit and heady sound palette is channeled into house, techno and more obscure selections. / Their work in the studio is a free­flowing ritual, an extension of what they do on stage. ‘Spread The Word’, their debut album came out Stem Records in 2014 and was followed by hit EPs for Maceo Plex’s Ellum Audio, their own label Obscura and Curle Recordings. A relationship with Tale Of Us and multiple appearances at Afterlife events has also led to Agents Of Time signing to Afterlife with the stunning ‘Dream Vision’ EP and 'Paradigm' on the Realm Of Consciousness compilation. / Perhaps the purest form of Agents Of Time’s music belongs to their own label Obscura. They inaugurated the label with the hypnotic, bassline wizardry of ‘Day One’ and in 2018 followed up with ‘Ordinary Cosmic Dance’. The label, which began as (and continues to be) a party series, has also provided a platform for like­minded artists through a double­vinyl compilation, and counts luminaries such as The Hacker, Antigone and Francois X amongst its roster. / The Agents Of Time are taking careful steps and showing themselves to be gifted, versatile performers with each one. Whether on record, on stage or at an Obscura event, count on a high­quality output, finely balanced between experimentation and a straight dancefloor vibe.","Dear Friends, I am sorry to say that the show is getting postponed to May.

3225,"SET with Kevin de Vries (Afterlife, Drumcode) & Ae:Ther (Afterlife, Crosstown Rebels)",2/28/2020,"ABOUT KEVIN DE VRIES  /  / Kevin de Vries is a young and upcoming producer based in Berlin, Germany. /  / Showing his very own trance-inspired techno sound in his first EP called “A Journey Through Life“, he gained the support from some of the biggest players in the industry, with names like Tale Of Us, Adam Beyer, Sven Väth, Richie Hawtin and many more supporting him. / With Releases on Major Labels like Afterlife, Cocoon or Drumcode, de Vries' ""continues to lock down his reputation as one of Europe's most promising techno talents"" as Mixmag said. /  / ABOUT AE:THER /  / Born and raised in Rome, with German DNA and a diverse musical palette Ae:ther is an artist who has quickly established his pedigree as a formidable producer and selector through scintillating DJ sets and a batch of stunning releases. /  / Now based in Berlin, the 29- year-old has returned to the motherland where he is steadily cultivating a reputation for haunting melodies and narcotic rhythms. With strong connections to Damian Lazarus at Crosstown Rebels and the Afterlife crew, Ae:ther has considerable industry support with his focus on delivering high-quality dance floor ready cuts that channel his love for ambient electronica and transmitting deep emotion, while keeping the energy levels high. /  / Ae:ther discovered club music early in his life, inspired by Underground Resistance and the early Detroit sound, along with artists like Autechre, Brian Eno, Tangerine Dream and Miles Davis - pioneers who pushed boundaries. As producing and DJing became a daily obsession, he left Rome to go and study in Milan. It was there, at the Istituto Europeo di Design (IED) that he studied Sound Design and his lifelong commitment to the exploration of sound and vibration really took hold. /  / From there he moved to London, a city where he matured and grew as an artist. After a couple of years he found a space at Fortress Studios in Old Street, where he befriended neighbours such as Bicep and assisted other artists with their music, his knowledge of sound design giving him the ability to add a whole other dimension to the artists he worked with. Six years in London gave Ae:ther all the experience he needed of life in a city that many consider to be the centre of the musical universe. /  / In 2017, enticed by the prospect of expanding his network and pushing his career forwards Ae:ther moved to Berlin. There he joined like-minded collaborators Mind Against and Tale Of Us, alongside a whole crew of new friends, and immersed himself in the highly fertile electronic music scene. The Berlin lifestyle; liberal, inclusive and supportive of the arts, has fed back into Ae:ther’s love for production, and taken him to a whole new level of musical expression. /  / As a producer he has been blazing a trail, his natural aptitude for crafting emotive, captivating compositions landing him several releases with Afterlife, including his exceptional EP ‘Spectre’, which was released in July 2018. Ae:ther’s love for experimental, ambient music lies at the core of his distinct sound. Coupled with deep underground influences and a meditative atmosphere, he programs taut percussion and juxtaposes it with dreamlike soundscapes, telling mesmerising stories with his synths. /  / This inimitable approach has brought him to the attention of one of the scene’s most influential figures, Damian Lazarus. He has commissioned Ae:ther to compose a remix of his exceptional single ‘All I Need’ with the Ancient Moons and has also signed his debut album. Another release with Afterlife is also scheduled for mid-2019. Besides that, Ae:ther has performed across Europe and is preparing to unleash his debut live set. A dazzling culmination of hours and hours spent on painstaking production and curation, the hour-long live show will showcase a wide range of Ae:ther’s largely unreleased productions; demonstrating his diversity and unparalleled talent. /  / At the birth of electronic music its visionary pioneers wanted to soundtrack the future, now that future is here it’s artists like Ae:ther who take up the mantle and guide us into the unknown. As part of the new vanguard he is perfectly poised to do just that, so strap yourself in and prepare to be transported into the next century.","Kevin de Vries (Afterlife, Drumcode, Anjunadeep) , Ae:ther (Afterlife, Crosstown Rebels)",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1379621,Monarch,san francisco,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60713-Activities-San_Francisco_California.html,'37.7809734', '-122.4084801'

For the Helliker-Hales brothers in Chaos In The CBD, it’s strictly a family thing. They may well be one of the hottest propositions in the current house firmament, but they’ve still managed to maintain the homespun vibe that comes from growing up in the idyllic suburbs of Auckland. /  / These days the duo – Louis and Ben (aka Beans) – are part of the tight knit Peckham dance community, but the chill summers of New Zealand’s North Island still hold a place in their fertile imagination. Having been schooled in the wares of bands like The Cure and Joy Division from their music-mad parents, it’s now the boys turning them onto house music and, yes, John Tejada. /  / Having built a reputation in the studio and followed it up with the constant rigours of the DJ touring life, they’re now ready to take stock, step back and examine where they want to be in ten years rather than the afterparty in three hours. They’ve taken the big step from having a laugh to building a career. “Plans?,” queries Louis. “We’ve got our own label and we invest a lot in that. It means we can release stuff at a rate which we want to. We also have a two tracker for Mule Musiq but then going forward, it's kind of open waters, though we do want to start working with outside labels again, it can be a bit of an echo chamber recording for yourself.” The label in question is their venture in tandem with fellow Kiwi Jon Sable, In Dust We Trust, which has so far yielded a sterling set of releases between the trio. /  / Kornél Kovács / — / Born 1985 in Stockholm to Hungarian parents, Kornél Kovács' perambulations in music began early and have continued at pace ever since. Raised on that classic, enviable diet of “proper” music training plus parents with killer music taste, Kovács' daytime lessons were given texture at night as everything from Kraftwerk and Art Of Noise to King Tubby and Boogie Down Productions wafted through the house. /  / Applying the Stakhanovite work ethic of his heritage to all he had learned so far, Kovács started knocking on as many of Stockholm's musical doors as possible, teaboying in the city's finest record stores, stalking its best DJs, working his way through the local library's excellent selection of dance music records. Kovács, then a “clumsy nerd who got to hang around the older cool kids because they found me funny”, even managed to wangle a few DJ gigs on the back of an intense early teenage love of mid-90s drum'n'bass, turning him into “Stockholm's youngest former jungle DJ” by the age of 14. /  / After a few years in this exquisitely premature retirement, Kovács picked his headphones up again in the mid-00s, and exciting things followed. Kovács had always written about music, and this, which he did for his own mp3 blog and various culture and music magazines, was joined by a DJ residency at Stockholm's legendary Paradise night, as well as a weekly radio show on P3, Sweden's Radio 1 equivalent. An unsurprisingly important stint at Red Bull Music Academy in 2008 was followed by the formation of Studio Barnhus with his best friends Axel Boman and Petter Nordkvist. At first a studio space and DJ trio, and a year later a record label, Studio Barnhus has now charted 50 releases and counting – the initial Good Children Make Bad Grown Ups EP was Kovács' first appearance on vinyl. /  / The collective's successes have drawn reams of prestigious press coverage in the years since and worldwide DJ dates for its three members, as well as giving Kovács the artistic space that eventually fostered 2014's Szikra, the track Kovács admits was what made him realise he could “actually make music that people appreciate”. Given all this, it would be wrong to describe last year's Pantalón, on Glasgow's Numbers imprint, as any kind of “breakout” moment. Its irresistible, snapping drums and Spanish-language vocal did get people talking and dancing though, while an appearance on Hamburg's esteemed Smallville imprint in the same year saw him connect with another of Europe's electronic music powerhouses. /  / Kovács' debut album, The Bells, is out on Studio Barnhus in August and was recorded during an intensive two-week session in Gothenburg with his great friend (and great studio engineer) Matt Karmil. Giving your debut LP the same name as the most influential techno track in history certainly takes balls. But after hearing how the album draws together Kovács' natural festive musicality and his long-standing love of club rhythmics, and then factoring in the juggernaut trajectory that's taken him from tea-making record store jester to globally acclaimed producer and DJ, you can certainly forgive his confidence. /  / Baltra / — / Fusing subtle fizzing beats, gently whirring melodies, engulfing atmospheres and tracks that weave between dance floor euphoria and isolated headphone listening, Baltra explores the depths and nuances of electronic music.","Chaos In The CBD, Kornél Kovács, Baltra, COMPUTER DATA , Experimental Housewife, Run The Length Of Your Wildness (Experimental Housewife, Roche, Blakeblakeblake, and Arnold)",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1347758,The Gre,san francisco,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60713-Activities-San_Francisco_California.html,'37.7676612', '-122.4065246'

We will have tickets available for the intimate set in the Loft on Friday. /  / Hi everyone, it’s atish again. /  / Just letting you know I’m doing my 4th edition of Atish All Night SF at Public Works in February. These Atish All Nights have been some of the most important gigs for me over the last few years because I came up as a DJ in San Francisco and built my strongest dance floor relationships with many of you. I feel grateful to have a platform to play open to close with my hometown audience. After these events, I also take some time to self-reflect to look back on how much style has changed since the last one...and how the dance floor has changed as well. These events are important milestones in my journey. Hopefully you can join for the next one. /  / As a note, all previous Atish All Nights have sold out, so best bet is to grab a pre-sale early while you can.  /  / What's more, I’m pretty excited and terrified about trying something new this year. I'm adding a 2nd event on Friday 28th in the PW Loft. Recently I’ve been buying a lot of music that doesn’t quite fit in the box of music that people expect from me, and I’ve been thinking long and hard about how to reconcile this other side of me without alienating the dance floor. So I’m using this Atish All Night Loft edition as an opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and experiment a little more with music that hasn’t yet made it into my sets. I’m not sure what the set will sound like, but I’m pretty sure it won’t be a typical ‘atish’ set (for better or for worse)!

Musically, the project touches on industrial, dub, techno, noise, and more, but does so with a distinctly personal, emotional touch. Using sequenced drums, guitar, voice, and layers of manipulated tape, Cube's sounds cover a broad range while retaining an unmistakably singular feel--intimate, personal, and raw. Fast pieces push industrial and techno into near-gabber territory.

In addition to his prolific output as a solo artist, and his ongoing investigation of the limits of noise, automatic composition, field music or contemporary classical, Fennesz is also a frequent collaborator with other luminaries of the scene.

Nebakaneza and Johnny 5 are two DJs obsessed with music of all kinds, but what brought them together was their love of Dubstep, and bass heavy music. They met online after listening to each other’s mixes. They got a gig together one night at a tiny club in Oakland, and everyone there seemed to think their music was too weird. It didn’t matter to them though. They immediately became close friends, and eventually brothers. They formed a partnership and decided to start throwing their own weird events in San Francisco that would cater to other like minded weirdos. They worked their butts off, and just kept booking more and more of their favorite weirdos. What started in a gritty hole in the wall in 2010, blossomed into the biggest reoccurring bass event in the country.  /  / Ritual has hosted over 200 events, and booked nearly 600 artists.

Debuting with a sold out show in San Francisco, J. Jaxx quickly recognized its demand, and expanded beyond its hometown by taking the show across the West Coast. / Whether on stage or behind the scenes, it's the attention to detail that will continue to translate into every project J.

3367,Cancelled /// Phonobar presents: Trus'me,3/27/2020,"With his love for music tracing way back to an early age by dabbling with various instruments and then moving on to develop a passion for record collecting, Trus’me found his calling after learning the art of mixing and sample digging. Surrounded by the heads of Manchester and its deep rooted music scene, one couldn’t deny that it was an effortless task to be exposed to good music from all genres, thus explaining his constantly evolving tastes as evident in his eclectic DJ sets as well as in his uniquely, diverse productions. “Like bookends some 12’s will work with both the beginning and the end of the night, such is the classy sampling from Trus’me” (Peter Nicholson, XLR8R). /  / The much reputed CD sampler “Nards” that was responsible for initialing releases on Chicago’s Still Music label, inevitably sparked off Trus’me’s promising musical career. Seeing support from respected names such as Ashley Beedle, Juan Atkins, Mad Matts, Gilles Peterson and Chez Damier plus his productions selling out at record stores from Manchester to Tokyo, led to the highly successful release of his debut album, “Working Nights”, on Fat City Recordings, that’s hailed by most to be a timeless album, still finding devotees to this day. /  / Not one to rest on his laurels, the label Prime Numbers was set up and quickly gained an unfaltering reputation for highly collectable and exceptional music from artistes such as Move D, Actress, Linkwood, Fudge Fingas, Motorcity Drum Ensemble; all artistes that fit the ethos and style that Trus’me continues to carry a torch for. In 2009, his highly anticipated follow-up album, “In The Red” that featured the likes of Chez, Damier, Amp Fiddler and Dam Funk further cemented his place in the House scene and set off a flurry remixes for acts such as LCD Soundsystem, Motor City Drum Ensemble, Alton Miller, Anthony Shake Shakir and more, including non-stop touring to clubs and festivals alike in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, North America, South America and of course, in his backyard, the city of Manchester where it all began. /  / Keeping up with his rough release rate of one new album every couple of years, Prime Numbers label boss Trus’me is back in 2016 with his fourth full length, Planet 4. Featuring nine cuts of intergalactic techno, it once again marks a considerable sonic evolution for the acclaimed UK artist. The latest album is a vehicle for his own interest in deep space, physics and dark matter. It is those subjects that have occupied his mind in recent years, and those subjects that inform this brilliantly otherworldly album. Where previous LPs have variously been funk and soul heavy, or openly analogue and physical, this one is a more subtle and supple techno affair that is as cerebral as it is seductive.",Trus'me,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1401813,Phonobar,san francisco,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60713-Activities-San_Francisco_California.html,'42.0563058', '-71.4274316736134'

3393,Holly Herndon,4/2/2020,"Electronic musician Holly Herndon and her live ensemble presage a sonic future that connects human and machine to realize new definitions of beauty. Her dance-inflected experimental music investigates the nature of humanity in the digital age—including her 2019 album PROTO, made in part with artificial intelligence. Drawing from folk traditions of East Tennessee, Berlin’s radical club culture, and her Stanford graduate studies on machine learning and music, Herndon’s complex and riveting music promises a unique live performance. /  / Since her arrival in 2012, Holly Herndon has successfully mined the edges of electronic and Avant Garde pop and emerged with a dynamic and disruptive canon of her own. Born in the mountains of East Tennessee, she went from singing in church to enrolling in a German exchange program. Adopting Berlin as a second home, she cut her teeth performing in the city’s clubs prior to attending Mills College. She utilized the laptop as “the most intimate instrument,” cultivating live voice processing systems and developing custom vocal patches to construct experimental pieces performed in real-time. She put those pieces into play on the likes of 'Breathe' and 'Dilato' from her full-length debut, Movement.  /  / Researching platform politics for her phD at Stanford, she assembled her 2015 sophomore offering Platform. Telematic performance at Stanford fueled 'DAO' and integrated custom sampling of daily activities online into the songcraft of 'Chorus' and 'Home'. As it sparked commentary on “platform politics”, Platform closed out 2015 by gracing year-end lists from Pitchfork, The Guardian, NME, and The Wire. Primarily composed alongside collaborators online, it was “the first commercially released album to include a track intended to trigger autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR).” Following the release, Radiohead handpicked her to open up its European tour.  /  / In 2019, she broke ground again on her third full-length, PROTO. She fronts and conducts an electronic pop choir comprised of both human and A.I. voices over a musical palette that encompasses everything from synths to Sacred Harp stylings. CNN says Holly is “shaping the future of A.I.” as she operates at the nexus of technological evolution and musical catharsis. /  / Tickets: http://grayarea.org/event/holly-herndon/",Holly Herndon,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1393858,Gray Area,san francisco,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60713-Activities-San_Francisco_California.html,'37.754435755102', '-122.41854744898'

3438,Nightmares on Wax Smokers Delight 25th Anniversary Tour,4/25/2020,"Nightmares On Wax will return in April, 2020 on a worldwide tour in celebration of the 25th Anniversary of his seminal album – Smokers Delight. A defining record of the mid 90s which set Nightmares on Wax on their own musical trajectory, Nightmares main man George Evelyn will be rekindling his much-loved downbeat blend of soul, hip-hop, dub and timeless club sounds, start to finish, with a full orchestrated live show next year. /  / He says “It’s amazing that i’m talking about my album Smoker Delight 25 years later! To say this will be an honour to perform this album live in its entirety at this point in my life right now, is an understatement. I’ve had so many incredible experiences from releasing music throughout my career, but let me share the fact that this album changed my life and opened me up to new opportunities of how I could produce music going forward. I am forever grateful for this moment in my life, bringing this back to the stage with such a special live show is going to be delightful on many levels.” /  / Smokers Delight was one of a handful of records to define a generation along with Massive Attack’s Blue Lines, Portishead’s Dummy and Tricky’s Maxinquaye. It took George Evelyn from his electronic-genre-blending debut 1991’s A Word of Science, into releasing the iconic downtempo, soul and hip hop material for which he has become renowned. Music lovers from around the world were intoxicated by this bassy, afterhours sound that became the backdrop to a million late-night living room sessions. Smokers Delight managed to capture that feeling and add a dash of light to the darkness, changing the musical landscape for Nightmares and the still young Warp label forever. /  / Evelyn’s recent output includes the critically and commercially acclaimed Nightmares on Wax Back to Mine compilation, released earlier this year, which saw him take the helm of the compilation for its 20th Anniversary, and his long-awaited eighth album Shape The Future [2018]. Energized by a recent run of globetrotting DJ sets, including residencies in Ibiza and London, Nightmares on Wax’s return will also hold some surprises.

Bringing together music, 3-D visuals and performance art, KRAFTWERK are a true „Gesamtkunstwerk„ a total work of art. /  / The multi-media project Kraftwerk was started in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. They set up their electronic Kling Klang Studio in Düsseldorf, Germany where they conceived and produced all Kraftwerk albums. By the mid-1970’s Kraftwerk had achieved international recognition for their revolutionary electronic‚ soundscapes and their musical experimentation with robotics and other technical innovations. With their visions of the future, Kraftwerk created the soundtrack for the digital age of the 21st century. Their compositions, using / innovative techniques, synthetic voices and computerized rhythms, have had a major / international influence across an entire range of music genres: from Electro to Hip Hop, from Techno to SynthPop. /  / In their live performances, Kraftwerk–Ralf Hütter, Henning Schmitz, Fritz Hilpert, Falk / Grieffenhagen–illustrate their belief in the respective contributions of both man and machine. Starting with the retrospective of their catalogue at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2012, in recent years Kraftwerk have returned full circle back to their origins within the Düsseldorf art scene of the late Sixties. The 3-D concert series at MoMA was followed by further presentations at Tate Modern Turbine Hall (London), Akasaka Blitz (Tokyo) Opera House (Sydney), Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles), Fondation Louis Vuitton (Paris), Neue National Galerie (Berlin) and Guggenheim Museum (Bilbao). In 2014 Ralf Hütter and his former partner were honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.",Kraftwerk,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1394897,Bill Graham Civic Auditorium,san francisco,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60713-Activities-San_Francisco_California.html,'37.778427', '-122.418057'

Lose your inhibitions on our Dancefloor and become one with the music. Dark room, big sound, and You!!!!! San Diego Move!!!!! /  / IN THE BEGINNING, THERE WAS JACK, AND JACK HAD A GROOVE, /  / And from this groove came the groove of all grooves, / And while one day viciously throwing down on his box, Jack boldy declared, / “Let there be HOUSE!” / and house music was born. /  / Bios: / Zernell / Zernell Gillie's style is the heart of disco to the soul of Chicago house music with a grimy twist. By taking rare disco classics and stripping them down and rebuilding them to a beating perfection it's no wonder why his imprint Grimy sells out worldwide. /  / Zernell was born in Chicago and started DJing at the age of 14. This was during the early years of house music and like a lot of Chicago teens he religiously listened to the Hot Mix 5 on WBMX. Zernell musically grew up in the Music Box and other Chicago clubs listening to the sounds of Ron Hardy and other early pioneers of house music and was schooled by the masters in the art of song selection and timing that drives dancers into a frenzy. Zernell’s Grimy style of music features some of the hottest and rarest house & disco songs and re-edits mixed just the right way to keep you dancing and wanting more, which has made Zernell one of the hottest dj’s in the underground scene today. /  / Zernell has done numerous parties in cities around the globe. He has toured the U.K. and Europe and headlined parties in London, The Netherlands,  / Italy, Sweden, France, Switzerland & Germany. Zernell’s passion for disco & house is as strong as it was in the 80’s and reflects in his extensive record collection of rare vinyl. Out of that passion Zernell created the label Grimy Edits, which have sold thousands of units worldwide. /  / Zernell Gillie's style can range from the heart of disco to the soul of Chicago house with a grimy twist. With over 30 years of Deejaying under his belt, it shows in all of his mixes & live performances. He heads the highly sought after record label Grimy Edits & the sister label Grimy Trax. He is the creator of the lifestyle brand Grimy Gear. He is the Co-founder of the Crate Diggers Record Fair & After-party series, and has a monthly show on NTS Radio LA. (“Get Grimy” w/Zernell) /  / Mark Quark / Succumbing to the influences of Industrial music, Acid House and Belgian New Beat, fresh young-hearted Mark Hanson’s alter ego and ambassador for shockingly good music Mark E. Quark was born at age eighteen. With a penchant for putting songs, beats, and lyrics together in ways that gave his listeners starry-eyes and loyal hearts, Mark E. Quark resolved to use his powers of DJ’ing only for good, not evil. However, he also resolved not to ever wear tights, a cape, or a mask at the same time so as to not focus on his superhero DJ status. Quark likes to keep the focus on the music. /  / ""With an ability to mesmerize audiences over Radio Waves, Internet Connections as well as any dance floor, Mark E. Quark has lit up audiences all over the world. He has played alongside (and counts among his fans) renowned producers and DJ’s Doc Martin, Derrick L. Carter, Lil Louie Vega, Kenny Hawkes, Gemini, Onionz, Dan Ghenacia, Ivan Smagghe, Juan Atkins, Hipp-E, Justin Harris, Phil Weeks, Hector Morales Mark Farina, the Wicked crew, Halo, Richard James (Aphex Twin) and Moby. /  / Mark E. Quark’s handwriting can be seen undeniably all over Southern California’s legendary nightlife scene. He was a pivotal force in the foundation of SOMA, Playskool, G-Force and gave assists to San Francisco heavyweight events The Gathering, Basics, By the People's Out Of Sight parties, Stompy Dig In, and Sunset. Quark’s also caused major foot-stomping with his own releases on Hi-Phen (Belgium), Camouflage (US) & Facade (US). /  / ""In a pinch, if forced to employ adjectives to describe the Mark E. Quark style, one would come up with words like “groovy, laid back and nasty” house music. But putting grammar aside, it’s reasonable to just say that Quark has internalized influences from DJ Harvey, Idjut Boys, Jeno + early Andrew Weatherall, mashed them up, and given life to a signature style and a creature which is totally unique. This creature is currently brought to life for public consumption on a bi-weekly basis at Moonshake, a collaboration with fellow DJ’s Dr. Indulgent + Bob Dazzla in San Diego."" /  / Vinyl Pop Up Curated By Pacific Beach Vinyl","Zernell (Grimy, LA), Mark Quark (San Diego), , Residents:, Vincent & Diskokitty",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1366781,ion San Diego presents: Jack Lives Here,san diego,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60750-Activities-San_Diego_California.html,'32.7169436', '-117.1692461'

Michael David and Tyler Blake formed the production duo in Los Angeles in 2005, initially under the name Young Americans. Friends since childhood, David had previously worked as a session guitarist and Blake had just finished music school when, in their early twenties, they decided to make electronic music together. The pair started playing house parties and remixing artists, focusing on indie rock (including Kill Hannah and Hellogoodbye). The duo changed their name to Classixx in 2008, debuting with a self-titled EP. Soon after, the single ""I'll Get You"" (featuring Jeppe of Junior Senior) appeared on Kitsuné Music, in addition to remixes of songs by Phoenix, Fischerspooner, Yacht, Holy Ghost!, and numerous others. In 2010, they produced Mayer Hawthorne's ""No Strings."" Signing to the Mountain Dew-funded Green Label Sound, the single ""Into the Valley"" was released in 2011. Two years later their debut full-length, Hanging Gardens, appeared on Innovative Leisure. Including ""I'll Get You"" in addition to songs featuring Active Child and LCD Soundsystem/the Juan MacLean's Nancy Whang, the album was critically acclaimed, and the duo became a popular touring act. Classixx's next album featured a wide range of guest vocalists, including Passion Pit's Michael Angelakos, De Luxe, Isles, Harriet Brown, and T-Pain. Faraway Reach was released in June of 2016.  /  / Website: http://Classixx.LA /  / Fred Falke / Musician & producer Fred Falke started his career as a bass player around 1995 and started his production work in the late 90's. / Since his first release of 'INTRO' on Vulture, Fred has dedicated himself to production work and remixes for the likes of Goldfrapp , Kelis and Jamiroquai. /  / Website: http://www.fredfalke.com /  / Zen Freeman / Zen Freeman has spent a lifetime spinning records.

Gigging from the Tate Modern to MOMA, stadiums, cranes, hotels, car parks, bridges, deserts, fashion launches, mountains, muddy fields, beaches, not to mention the most prestigious clubs in the world. Critical and fan support have closely followed her career with Maya picking up multiple awards including Beatport's 'Staff Pick: Artist of the year' and ‘Best Producer', ‘Best DJ’, ‘Best Compilation’ or ‘Best Underground Track’ from Mixmag and DJ to FACT and SPIN. /  / Indeed, Maya has already graced the cover of over 20 magazines in 8 different countries including twice for Mixmag (UK), DJ Mag (UK), Village Voice (USA), Trax (France), Groove (Germany) and Vicious (Spain), alongside coverage as diverse as Vogue and Nylon through to Rolling Stone, Wall Street Journal and GQ. Maya even found time to front an international campaign for Dr. Martens. /  / So why all the fuss? Well, Maya is somewhat of an enigma; on a typical Maya Jane Coles record, Maya will have written, produced, engineered, arranged, mixed and performed every element of the track; some times top-lining and, on many occasions, even designing the sleeve artwork too. Maya is no overnight success, rather someone who has been paying their dues and honing their craft for years… /  / First intrigued by the musical mixture of sounds from dub to punk to soul to jazz to world to classical music played at home; Maya began to pick up a few instruments herself and started song writing. /  / Production felt like the natural next step to release her own vision at every part of the process from beginning to end. First producing hip-hop at 15, Maya migrated to dubbier electronic sounds aged 16 and following the experience of exploring good underground house in the clubs and warehouses of East London she started to make house records, culminating in her first release ‘Sick Panda’ on Dogmatik back in in 2007. The release led to gigs at events like the BBC Electric Proms and Bestival. /  / Whilst earlier tracks were all well received it is arguably ‘What They Say’, originally released on Real Tone, that would see Maya rise up the ranks of the underground house scene. Topping both the sales charts on Beatport and Resident Advisor’s charts week upon week. Further Maya productions ‘Don’t Put Me In Your Box’ EP (Hypercolour), ‘Humming Bird’ EP (Hypercolour), ‘Focus Now’ EP (20:20 Vision), ‘Beat Faster’ EP (Mobilee) cemented her position and built anticipation for Maya’s debut LP ‘Comfort’. /  / Led by the single ‘Easier to Hide’ in 2012, July 2013 saw the release of Maya’s debut album ‘Comfort’ on her I/AM/ME imprint. The record was produced, engineered and mixed solely by Maya herself. She even created the artwork for the album and all of the singles. Maya's debut was critically acclaimed, delivering an eclectic melting pot of sound and texture drawing on everything from house and techno through to R&B and Dub. Vocal guests on the record included Tricky, Miss Kittin, Kim Ann Foxman, Karin Park, Nadine Shah and Thomas Knights; the latter also directed two of the album’s music videos! /  / 2014 saw a club smash ‘Getting Freaky’ on Heidi's Jackathon Jams and a return to Dogmatik with ‘Watcher’. Maya also collaborated with GAPS on a Mobilee EP release. Maya in turn released a GAPS album to mark the first release on I/AM/ME other than her own material in 2015. /  / In 2015, Maya’s eponymous album under her bass driven ‘Nocturnal Sunshine’ alias, won best Producer at the DJ Mag awards and was further included in DJ Mag’s Top 10 Albums of 2015. Again Maya took on all duties from music to artwork with Catnapp and Chelou the only guest artists on the album. Maya has also remixed emergent talents The Orb, Karin Park and Phil Kieran, and originals ‘Can’t Hide The Way I Feel/Broke’. Maya would debut the moniker on her own branded stage at Secret Garden and later play a handful of special gigs under the moniker alongside Jamie XX in NYC and Bonobo in London. /  / 2017 saw Maya release her most substantial body of work to date; her sophomore album ‘Take Flight’ on her own label, I/AM/ME. The 24 track album peaked at number 37 in the overall UK albums chart during the week of release, number 26 in the Independent label chart and number 15 in the Billboard Dance and Electronic Album Sales Chart. The album received immense support, receiving a 72% score on Metacritic, gaining coverage from a number of high tier publications including Mixmag, Pitchfork and Billboard, as well as receiving DSP support such as a banner on the iTunes Electronic page, a spot in Spotify New Releases, Apple Music New Releases and was named Beatport Artist of the Week. Maya gained 2 ‘Essential New Tunes’ from Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1 for two of her singles from the album, ‘Cherry Bomb’ and ‘Trails’ and to top of her year, she won Best Album and Best Producer at the DJ Mag Best of British Awards 2017 off the back of her ‘Take Flight’ album. /  / 2017/2018 also saw Maya gain a number of selected mix placements such as her Essential Mix, which was shortlisted for Essential Mix of the Year, Annie Mac’s Mini Mix, Channel 4 Best Before, Beats1 Mix as well as Radio 1 Live in Ibiza. As well as supporting Depeche Mode on the European tour and further releasing album EPs. /  / The end of 2018, saw Maya simultaneously release a new stand alone EP “Waves & Whirlwinds” as Maya Jane Coles and the first new music in years under her Nocturnal Sunshine alias the bass driven “Foundation/Heroes”. Maya would announce a second yet untitled Nocturnal Sunshine album will be released at some point in 2019. /  / Maya has also produced acts such as Alpines, Nimmo and Little Boots recently working with Chelou on his cult single ‘Halfway to Nowhere’ and five tracks on his forthcoming debut album. /  / Also a prolific remixer with Maya’s credits include Depeche Mode, The XX, Bonobo, Massive Attack, Tricky, Little Dragon, Sia, Florence & The Machine, Peaches, and even the legendary Ella Fitzgerald! /  / Maya’s breakthrough track ‘What They Say’ was slowed and looped to form the backing track for Nicki Minaj’s ‘Truffle Butter’. The track - featuring Lil Wayne and Drake – went on to receive a Grammy Nomination and peaked at 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, placing at 66 for 2015 overall. The track has sold over a million copies around the world with artists such as T.I. and Ludacris releasing cover versions. /  / “What They Say” was sampled again in Katy’s Perry 2017 hit “Swish Swish” ft Nicki Minaj which went platinum in the USA, Canada and Australia; as well as Gold in the UK, France and Italy. /  / Alongside her production and remixing credentials, Maya is an esteemed DJ. Aged 17, Maya bought herself a pair of 1210′s and learned how to mix on vinyl, and since then Maya's reputation as a DJ has reached heady proportions with acclaimed mixes for Resident Advisor, XLR8R, Boiler Room, a Mixmag cover-mount CD and multiple Essential Mixes. /  / In April 2012, Maya's position as one of the world's top DJs was further solidified with the release of her multi-award winning edition to K7's legendary DJ Kicks mix series, which gained international chart success and massive critical praise.

We're so excited to have him cross the pond and join us on our rooftop jungle on Sunday March 1st from 3-9 PM at Spin San Diego /  / Rounding out the lineup we have Shuski, rising San Diego star and Front Left head honcho Matt Egbert /  / TICKETS ON SALE NOW! /  / TIX: https://bit.ly/30DMdnG /  / Spin San Diego / 2028 Hancock St / 3PM - 9PM /  / Bontan [Crosstown Rebels/Hot Creations| UK] / Shuski / Matt Egbert /  / SIDE ROOM TBA / LIVE ART & VENDORS /  / ---------------- / Bontan has become one of the biggest ever selling acts in Beatport, been nominated in the DJ Awards and is taking over the underground house scene with a string of releases on the likes of Hot Creations, 20/20 Vision, Elrow Music and Circus Recordings. His story is inspiring to anybody wanting to make their mark on dance music, his story is proof that good things happen to good people.  /  / Based in the North West of England, the much-liked DJ/producer has grown from humble beginnings as a resident DJ in 2011, honing his craft in the sweaty intimate basements of his hometown of Southport and growing through to supporting the likes of Masters At Work, and Dennis Ferrer at Southport Weekender.  /  / The DJ turned producer has since gone on to win numerous accolades with his studio exports, most notably being presented with an award for the biggest selling record of 2013 by Beatport for his sterling remix of Josh Butler’s ‘Got A Feeling’ on MTA Records, which was #1 for six weeks and would still today be the second highest selling record of all time on the platform. This would continue the exciting story for the young newcomer, one that would lead to performances at Creamfields Festival (Liverpool), Lovebox (London), Pacha Festival (Amsterdam) and a residency at the infamous Sankey’s Soap Box Manchester. /  / In 2015, he would catch the attention of BBC Radio 1’s key dance music gatekeeper Pete Tong who would announce him as a Future Star off the back of releases on Circus Recordings and 2020Vision setting the tone for a hectic touring schedule over the next year. /  / It would be 2017 though where Bontan would up the game. His first release of the year ‘Call You Back’, another coming together with Josh Butler on Origins Rcrds, would climb to #1 on Beatport and go on to be streamed over 500,000 online. A stand out release for both artists. /  / True to form, Bontan swiftly followed up with his debut on Hot Creations. The First Time EP was premiered by Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1 and was supported by the likes of Faze Magazine, Tsugi and DJ Mag. It went on to receive over 300 radio plays worldwide and again streamed over 500,000 times as both tracks from the EP reached #3 (The First Time) and #8 (Personal Questions) in the Beatport Main Chart. There are not many acts who can stake a claim to three records in the top 10 chart at one time. /  / The First Time would go on to become Hot Creations biggest selling record of the year, and make Bontan the highest selling artist Beatport across all genres, laying the foundations for a defining year for the young artist. With a touring schedule reaching new territories including Australia, South America and North America, Bontan is proof that good things happen to good people.","Bontan, Shuski, Matt Egbert",https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1377940,Spin,san diego,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60750-Activities-San_Diego_California.html,'32.7456704100782', '-117.19137917135'

Education. /  / Three intertwining principles that form the foundation of the career of B.Traits. A journey that has seen her relocate from British Columbia, Canada to London, England; cement her reputation as a trusted selector at countless leading music events; start ‘In Toto’, her record label; become an established and respected radio broadcaster for BBC Radio 1 through which she vehemently championed cutting edge underground electronic music for 6 years and become an advocate for drug education and nightlife preservation within her adopted home. Underpinning all these achievements is B’s passion for sounds from across the musical spectrum, and her now well documented rampant eclecticism. /  / A significant next step in her continuous path to being one of the most distinguished artists in her field is her own record label: In Toto. A desire for complete artistic freedom and a boundless musical direction lie at the heart of B’s decision to start her own imprint, which sees releases ranging from house to techno to electro, and everything in between. Of her label, B.Traits has said: “It is a vehicle for me to put out my own and other artists' music on both vinyl and digital format. Music that I make, music that I love and music that I wish to share with you.”  /  / Website: http://www.btraits.com /  / La Fleur / Don’t even think about putting Sweden’s La Fleur into a box. For a start, she’s had too many twists and turns in her career to be edged into one particular corner. She actually started her working life as a pharmacist – but despite her acute understanding of laboratories, her passion was for an altogether different kind of mixing. Building on the success of the ‘Flowerhead’ EP on her own label Power Plant, her key electronic releases so far have included the ‘Nightflow’ and ‘Arms Around’ EPs (remixed by Detroit legends Kenny Larkin and Carl Craig respectively), as well as remixes for both Kerri Chandler and Sasha. In 2018 she’s enjoying a rich vein of form, starting with the acclaimed ‘Exhaust’, which was released on Adam Beyer’s Truesoul imprint, followed by a strong EP in May titled ‘Outbreaker’ on Watergate Records, featuring a remix by Tuff City Kids, the buzzed side project of Gerd Janson. In August she laid down a critically acclaimed debut Essential Mix that received plaudits from across the industry. The year was also highlighted by a standout collaboration with Sasha titled ‘Förbindelse’ that was anointed Essential New Tune by Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1. With a remix for Damian Lazarus & Ancient Moons due before the end of the year, alongside a heavy tour schedule that sees her play Junction 2, Oasis Festival, Melt Festival, Drumcode Festival and Warehouse Project, she’s making her mark as one of the most exciting talents in house and techno. The Mixmag Breakthrough DJ Award at the end of 2017 was certainly well-deserved /  / Instagram: www.instagram.com/lafleur_official /  / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - / Spin Nightclub /  / www.spinnightclub.com/ / www.twitter.com/spinnightclub / www.instagram.com/spinnightclubsd /  / VIP: [email protected] or 619-333-0029 /  / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - / FNGRS CRSSD: /  / Facebook: www.facebook.com/FNGRSCRSSD / Instagram: www.instagram.com/fngrscrssd / Twitter: www.twitter.com/FNGRSXCRSSD / Website: www.CRSSD.com","B.

His songs are filled with minimal yet propulsive beats, detailed production, and yearning vocals recalling Thom Yorke. He often performs and records with pianist Felix Lehmann and drummer Christian Dammann, in addition to writing with lyricist Ryan Mathiesen. Blomqvist began singing and playing guitar as a youth, and got into techno at the age of 21, after which he decided to pursue music as a career. He spent his nights working as a bartender at a club and making tracks, developing his blend of minimal techno and pop songwriting. In 2011, he released two singles on Philip Bader's Dantze label, including an interpretation of Angus & Julia Stone's ""Big Jet Plane,"" and performed his first festival gig. In early 2012, he sang on Oliver Koletzki's ""The Devil in Me."" Soon after, Koletzki's Stil Vor Talent label released Blomqvist's Ink EP. During the next three years, Blomqvist played over 300 gigs throughout the world, and released a handful of additional singles, leading up to Remote Control, his debut full-length, which was issued by Armada in 2016. Following a remix collection, the single ""Winter Roads"" was issued by Days Like Nights in 2017.  /  / Website: http://www.janblomqvist.com /  / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - / Quartyard: /  / Facebook: www.facebook.com/quartyardsd / Instagram: www.instagram.com/quartyardsd / Website: www.quartyardsd.com.com /  / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - / FNGRS CRSSD: /  / Facebook: www.facebook.com/FNGRSCRSSD / Instagram: www.instagram.com/fngrscrssd / Twitter: www.twitter.com/FNGRSXCRSSD / Website: www.CRSSD.com",Jan Blomqvist,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1387251,Quartyard,san diego,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60750-Activities-San_Diego_California.html,'32.711464', '-117.1026085'

3586,Kraftwerk 50th Anniversary 3-D Tour,6/25/2020,"After their worldwide hugely successful 3-D concert tours, the Electro pioneers Kraftwerk announce North American tour dates for summer 2020. Bringing together music, 3-D visuals and performance art, KRAFTWERK are a true „Gesamtkunstwerk„ a total work of art. /  / The multi-media project Kraftwerk was started in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. They set up their electronic Kling Klang Studio in Düsseldorf, Germany where they conceived and produced all Kraftwerk albums. By the mid-1970’s Kraftwerk had achieved international recognition for their revolutionary electronic‚ soundscapes and their musical experimentation with robotics and other technical innovations. With their visions of the future, Kraftwerk created the soundtrack for the digital age of the 21st century. Their compositions, using / innovative techniques, synthetic voices and computerized rhythms, have had a major / international influence across an entire range of music genres: from Electro to Hip Hop, from Techno to SynthPop. /  / In their live performances, Kraftwerk–Ralf Hütter, Henning Schmitz, Fritz Hilpert, Falk / Grieffenhagen–illustrate their belief in the respective contributions of both man and machine. Starting with the retrospective of their catalogue at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2012, in recent years Kraftwerk have returned full circle back to their origins within the Düsseldorf art scene of the late Sixties. The 3-D concert series at MoMA was followed by further presentations at Tate Modern Turbine Hall (London), Akasaka Blitz (Tokyo) Opera House (Sydney), Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles), Fondation Louis Vuitton (Paris), Neue National Galerie (Berlin) and Guggenheim Museum (Bilbao). In 2014 Ralf Hütter and his former partner were honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.",Kraftwerk,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1394900,Balboa The,san diego,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60750-Activities-San_Diego_California.html,'32.597701', '-117.067971'

Featuring guests as eclectic as Australian electro-indie artist Vancouver Sleep Clinic and emerging singer/songwriter Saint Sinner, the album abounds in elegantly sculpted beats and unearthly synth tones, along with poignant piano melodies that cut right to the heart. With each track showing OTR’s natural sophistication as an arranger and composer, Lost at Midnight embodies an emotional complexity that’s infinitely spellbinding: at turns melancholy and euphoric, cinematic and intimate, it leaves the listener endlessly in thrall to its delicate grandeur. /  / With its standout tracks including the soulful lead single “Heart” ft. Shallou (a hit #1 on the Sirius XM Chill chart), Lost at Midnight spotlights the singular sonic identity OTR first discovered during a life-changing stint in Japan. At the age of 22, while studying aerospace engineering in grad school, the Ohio native otherwise Ryan Chadwick landed a last-minute internship in the remote Japanese town of Kurashiki. Living alone and faced with a major language barrier, the novice musician bought a MIDI keyboard and started creating his own compositions, tapping into the elementary skills he’d gained by playing on a dusty old piano back in his college dorm. As he taught himself production, Chadwick began bringing his keyboard along while riding the bullet train all over Japan, taking in his beautifully strange surroundings and infusing those feelings of isolation and wonder into his music. /  / Website: http://www.musicbyotr.com /  / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - / Bang Bang: /  / Facebook: www.facebook.com/BangBangSanDiego / Twitter: www.twitter.com/BangBangSD / Website: www.bangbangsd.com /  / For bottle service inquiries please contact: / Zane Dashty / (619)760-6761 / [email protected] /  / No flip flops / No Shorts / No Tank tops / No Jerseys /  / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - / FNGRS CRSSD: /  / Facebook: www.facebook.com/FNGRSCRSSD / Instagram: www.instagram.com/fngrscrssd / Twitter: www.twitter.com/FNGRSXCRSSD / Website: www.CRSSD.com",OTR,https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1399703,Bang Bang,san diego,,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attractions-g60750-Activities-San_Diego_California.html,'32.711737', '-117.159509'
